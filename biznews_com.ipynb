      "FIU Business International MBA program ranked No. 3 in nation by U.S. News &#8211; BizNews\n",
      "FIU Business\n",
      "U.S. News &amp; World Report has ranked the FIU Business International MBA Program at No. 3 in the U.S., a jump from No. 8 last year, and the highest graduate program ranking in the college’s history. The new ranking places FIU Business right behind Harvard Business School and ahead of business schools at such institutions as the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University, Columbia University and New York University, all of which are also in the Top 10.\n",
      "“We are honored to see our International MBA program ranked among some of the world’s most elite programs,” said Joanne Li, dean of FIU Business. “The ranking reflects our continued commitment to excellence in international business education and research, our leadership in this area, and our success in impacting our graduates’ careers.”\n",
      "The U.S. News MBA rankings, released March 30, also place the FIU Business part-time MBA program at No. 64 among public school programs. The new rankings follow the U.S. News undergraduate international business school rankings, which placed FIU Business at No. 2 in the U.S. for the second year in a row.\n",
      "In addition to the MBA rankings, European Business Review, also in March, placed FIU’s Center for Leadership on a list 10 top places for executive education in 2021. The list includes London Business School, the Wharton School and Columbia Business School and other top business schools around the world.\n",

      "BankUnited iCare Scholarship targets students engaged in diversity. &#8211; BizNews\n",
      "Ellen Forman\n",
      "In the summer of 2020, BankUnited launched its iCARETM program. The mission of iCARETM, which stands for Inclusive Community of Advocacy, Respect and Equality, is to create a safe, diverse and inclusive workplace where individuals are valued for their talents, feel free to express themselves and are empowered to achieve their fullest potential.\n",
      "Through the iCARETM program, BankUnited has committed nearly half a million dollars to supporting diversity and inclusion at FIU Business, including a scholarship, internships, mentoring, and engagement in equity and justice initiatives.\n",
      "The bank’s recent gift, to be distributed over a five-year period, will support two programs designed to promote workforce diversity and achievement as part of its new iCARETM initiative, also underway with two other colleges in Florida. The gift will create full-tuition scholarships established as the BankUnited iCARETM Business Scholarship Fund. FIU Business juniors and seniors are eligible for the scholarship, which will be awarded annually based on academic performance or potential, and financial need. A preference will be given to students who have demonstrated experience in or a commitment to working with racial and ethnic minorities.\n",
      "Eric Hibbert, an executive vice president at BankUnited who leads the iCARETM program, noted that the scholarship’s minimum GPA requirement of 2.5 is designed to promote inclusion of students who have both academic achievement and academic potential, and will come with mentorship and hopefully provide opportunities otherwise not readily available.\n",
      "“We want to find students who may have taken a longer or harder road to get here, but have shown inspirational resilience and need financial assistance and mentorship to affirm their journey,” Hibbert said. “It’s part of a larger effort to bring greater opportunity and diversity into the workforce. We may not be able to tackle everything, but we believe we can make a difference through initiatives like these,” he said.\n",
      "“When thinking about talent management, we spend a significant amount of time thinking about how to effectively recruit and retain young banking professionals,” Hibbert said. “We can choose to recruit from other companies’ employees, or we can take students who are teachable and driven, as early as their junior year in undergraduate studies, and groom them to be the next generation of banking leaders.”\n",
      "The iCARETM program has also brought BankUnited executives and employees into virtual dialogues with FIU Business students, enabling them to share their personal thoughts, questions, insights and experiences about diversity, equity and inclusion within their career and leadership journey.\n",
      "“BankUnited and its leadership team are true partners in our mission and vision at FIU Business,” said Joanne Li, dean of the college. “We are honored to be selected for the iCARETM program, which brings vital financial help and critically important mentorship opportunities to our diverse, hard-working students. This is a program that articulates our shared purpose of changing lives.”\n",

      "Cynthia Corzo\n",
      "With an eye toward the importance of career reinvention, the FIU Business 2021 Power Up Women’s Leadership Summit encouraged participants to “flip the switch.” The virtual event, held on March 8, International Women’s Day, drew 280 participants.\n",
      "Amid an era of profound change driven by the pandemic, when more than two million women have left the U.S. labor force, Power Up speakers encouraged participants to stay committed to their search for opportunities and seek to open doors to positive change. The focus: empowering women professionally and in leadership roles.\n",
      "Among the speakers was Raquel “Rocky” Egusquiza, president of the Miami Marlins Foundation and newly-appointed and first-ever vice president of diversity for the Miami Marlins, who urged participants to search for an employer that respected their goals and values.\n",
      "“When sometimes we have a seat at the table, we’re so happy that we forget why it’s happening,” said Egusquiza. “We have to make sure our voice is heard, make it heard with that same courage it took us to get there in the first place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Power Up summit featured a presentation by students, faculty and mentors of the first ATOM Pink Tank, which helps women enter STEM fields &#8211; science, technology, engineering and math &#8211; by giving them support and experience. The goal: encourage women to seek out STEM-related jobs, which are in some of the fastest-growing fields of the future.\n",
      "Showcasing their skills, the Pink Tank women presented a data analysis of issues face by women while executives from Pink Tank sponsor BankUnited spoke about the importance of the experience and urged young women to follow their dreams.\n",
      "Executive coach Shanequa Fleming, CEO of Culture Accelerators, moderated the event. Addressing the group, she described challenges as opportunities in disguise that drive the need for change.\n",
      "“This is a cause for you to move differently, to expand your view, your sphere of influence and of control,” said Fleming. “As leaders, we have to be constantly finding ways to disrupt the things that you do, to disrupt yourself.”\n",
      "Two more virtual “Power Up Power Hour” presentations will be held July 8 and November 8, leading up to the 2022 Power Up Women’s Leadership Summit which is expected to be in person.\n",
      "Now in its sixth year, the FIU Power Up Women’s Leadership Summit has sought to empower women at every stage of their careers through expert insight and community building.\n",

      "The realism of a case study is critical for students entering the healthcare marketplace. &#8211; BizNews\n",
      "Cynthia Corzo\n",
      "Preparing students for leadership in healthcare management requires connecting classroom theory with real-world practice. To provide that connection, students in the FIU Business Healthcare MBA program take on a case study as part of their capstone project, working directly with practitioners to analyze a healthcare policy issue and present their findings and conclusions to leadership.\n",
      "Miriam Weismann\n",
      "The real-world success of that experience, which arms students with the skills most sought after in healthcare management careers, was presented to members of the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) at a February 2021 webinar. Miriam Weismann, academic director of the Healthcare MBA program was joined by Sue Ganske, clinical professor of accounting at FIU Business and Osmel Delgado, former COO of Cleveland Clinic Florida. The three shared their experience of collaborating on a project at a presentation titled “A Primer to Developing a Case Study.”\n",
      "“Cases give your students the opportunity to address real healthcare problems and present real solutions in the marketplace,” said Weismann. “The student becomes the decision-maker.”\n",
      "The experience drew praise from Delgado, who now serves as COO of Healthcare Outcomes Performance Company.\n",
      "Sue Ganske\n",
      "“Students learned side-by-side with me; solving challenges and problems simultaneously as I’m thinking about them,” he said. “The case study gives me the ability to approach an issue with students in a learning environment.”\n",
      "When the Affordable Care Act moved hospital reimbursement from a pay-for-services rendered model to a pay-for-performance model, Weismann and Ganske analyzed the impact on Cleveland Clinic and developed the case study with Delgado. Today, it’s part of the Healthcare MBA program’s curriculum.\n",
      "“Addressing a real-world situation and developing a solution is not easy,” noted Harold Vera (MBA ’18, BBA ’09), who worked on the case study as a student at FIU and is now a certified managed care analyst at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. “Collaboration is essential.”\n",
      "The hands-on work with practitioners delivered by case study projects also builds on collaboration and provides students with important perspectives in the reality of a rapidly evolving healthcare industry.\n",
      "“We give our students the practical information and this is how you can use it,” said Ganske. “Then they can immediately apply it in the workplace.”\n",

      "Ellen Forman\n",
      "As part of its ongoing effort to combat structural racism, FIU Business has been awarded a $100,000 grant from Altria to establish a unique multi-platform program designed to train more inclusive leaders and further the goals of diversity and justice.\n",
      "The three-part project strives to open a conversation and programmatically address challenges of inclusion and equity through financial support, academic coursework and purpose-driven dialogue.\n",
      "The grant, running through summer 2021, will fund:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Altria “Real Talk” Series, bringing together Altria team members and FIU Business students for a series of conversations on structural racism, with the goal of developing a more just, inclusive workforce,\n",
      "A pilot program for development and implementation of a diversity micro-credential by FIU Business faculty members over a one year period, with the potential for expansion to alumni and the wider local business community,\n",
      "A scholarship for FIU Business students engaged in the advancement of diversity and inclusion through coursework and activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work will serve to expand some of the college initiatives created in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests this summer, including the three-part Conversations on Race and Equity and the appointments of Diversity Student Ambassadors at FIU Business. At FIU, the nation’s largest minority serving institution, these efforts are part of a movement to expand opportunities and amplify voices of black community members who have often gone unheard in the past.\n",
      "Danielle Mackie, associate manager, recruiting at Altria Group Distribution Company, who led the company’s role in shaping the grant said, “We at Altria saw an opportunity to partner with an innovative, forward thinking, diverse university on how we can co-create content that will help build the workforce of the future. This grant will enable students to share their experiences and perspectives and have access to opportunities they otherwise would not have.”\n",
      "Through the partnership between Altria and FIU Business, Mackie added, “we will be able to permeate the current workforce environment with leaders who are empathetic, understand and appreciate diversity, and can engage in a way that will truly transform the places where we live and work.”\n",
      "As part of the new initiative, Altria executives will serve as individual business coaches, challenging students to “dream bigger” and teaching them how to enhance their career paths and navigate their corporate journey.\n",
      "The micro-credential is being developed by Kisha Jones and Brooke Buckman, faculty members in the Department of Global Leadership and Management, who have been involved in multiple college efforts focusing on diversity and inclusion. Pieces of the four-part module will be integrated into the curriculum for the college’s Management major.\n",

      "Lauren Comander\n",
      "As organizations reimagine the future and redesign business models, leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic doesn’t look all that different from leadership during times of normalcy, said Shanequa Fleming, CEO of Culture Accelerators, during “A Leadership Mindset,” a Wertheim Wisdom Wednesdays virtual event.\n",
      "Leaders should keep an eye on changes happening around them, maintain self-awareness and create a culture of communication and support, Fleming said during the hour-long conversation moderated by Jennifer Quintana, executive director of development for the College of Business.\n",
      "“Leadership really begins in the mind, so cultivate a mindset of: ‘Who will I have to be as a leader to create the outcomes that I want in my team and my organization?’” Fleming said.\n",
      "Shanequa Fleming\n",
      "While ‘Zoom’ became a noun, then a verb, then a diagnosis as the pandemic exploded, the shift to a digital economy was a decade in the making and astute leaders prepared for this. Looking ahead, Fleming said, 85 percent of the jobs that will exist in 2030 don’t exist today, according to research authored by the Institute for the Future.\n",
      "The Institute for The Future (IFTF). This is published in a report by Dell Technologies and authored by the Institute for The Future.\n",
      "“You have to be able to understand the story it is telling us and as leaders, move forward,” she said.\n",
      "Companies looking to reinvent themselves should collaborate with others in the industry. “There is no status quo because everyone is open to doing new things and taking advantage,” Fleming said. “Eventually the dust will settle and people will go back into comfortability, and it will become harder.”\n",
      "As leaders navigate these unchartered waters, they should constantly reevaluate themselves and seek feedback from employees. “If we don’t know who we are as leaders and what we believe in, it makes it extremely challenging to be decisive – and leaders have to be decisive,” Fleming said.\n",
      "They also need to reconsider what it means to be productive now that work is largely remote. “Debunk some of the old myths about how work gets done and where work gets done,” she said. “Instead of measuring our progress based on meetings we’ve had, understand how to engage digitally and how to highlight our impact in ways to show the value of what we do.”\n",
      "Make employees feel valuable and create a flexible, supportive environment to stem the exodus of women from the workforce, especially because companies will come back stronger than ever and need talent.\n",
      "“Companies can’t afford to lose women leaders,” Fleming said. And in working to solve issues around diversity, equity and inclusion, ask people what they need rather than assume. For example, Fleming said, don’t expect her to speak for every African American but let her share her own story: “People don’t hear your story; they hear their story in your story.”\n",

      "“We must not walk away from this mission of understanding how to help those students,” said Joanne Li, dean of the College of Business, said at the meeting.\n",
      "The HyFlex Town Hall, which enabled some employees to attend in-person and others to attend virtually, was the first all-school in-person meeting for faculty and staff since the pandemic began. It was held in the same way HyFlex classes have been held since last fall.\n",
      "At the event, 37 attended in person, with social distancing, face masks and various safety measures in place, and another 249 did so remotely. During an intermission, many faculty and staff members who haven’t seen each other outside of a webcam and video conferences since the pandemic started, were able to mingle and reconnect (also with social distancing and face coverings).\n",
      "During the meeting, college leadership shared information about the upcoming summer and fall semesters. They noted that the summer A and C semesters will likely have limited fully remote classes, while the fall and summer B terms will be in-person, hybrid or online.\n",
      "Leadership also shared information on enrollment. William Hardin, associate dean of the Chapman Graduate School said the graduate programs posted double digit enrollment increases.\n",

      "Currently, students of four public high schools in Miami-Dade County and parents participate in the National Academy Foundation’s (NAF) Academy of Finance (AOF) program. The five-year grant will allow the clinic team to deliver the Truist-FIU Finance curriculum to eight high schools in Miami-Dade County Public Schools.\n",
      "Additionally, the program, which began in person and is now offered virtually, will be made available to schools in other Florida districts and nationally. On the national level, teachers and high school students in at least 140 U.S. cities will have access to the curriculum.\n",
      "The technology-intensive Truist FIU Financial Wellness Clinic aims to increase college readiness and financial literacy for participants, who learn how to responsibly spend, save, borrow, and be smart consumers when shopping for financial services and insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Financial literacy skills are vitally important for both students and their parents, who must make prudent, well-informed financial decisions as they approach college and careers,” said FIU Business Dean Joanne Li. “We are grateful for the support of the Truist Foundation, which has enabled FIU Business to share our knowledge base of financial planning skills with not only our South Florida community but also with families across the nation.”\n",
      "The expansion of the program will begin virtually in spring 2021. As FIU’s campus repopulation allows, students from selected schools will be able to visit the Truist FIU Financial Wellness Clinic several times per year for workshops on various financial literacy topics.\n",
      "“At Truist, we understand the importance of building wealth to improve economic mobility, and we want to instill those concepts in students as early in life as possible,” said Tony Coley, South Florida regional president for Truist, speaking on behalf of the Truist Foundation. “Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities, and we know financial wellness leads to happiness and future success.”\n",

      "Ellen Forman\n",
      "Starting a new business venture is among the most popular goals of the new year. Yet many potential founders quickly hit the wall, deterred by the slim prospect of finding venture capital (VC) to finance their endeavor.\n",
      "That’s a big mistake, says Dileep Rao, clinical professor at FIU Business, Forbes blogger, and a frequent speaker on entrepreneurship issues. Rao has made it his mission to train entrepreneurs to develop growth ventures without VC by building their skill sets and using the tactics of billion-dollar entrepreneurs.\n",
      "In his new book, Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs, Rao shares insights derived from over four decades of financing, interviewing and analyzing more than 120 billion-dollar entrepreneurs and hundred-million-dollar entrepreneurs who built giant ventures from scratch.\n",
      "Dileep Rao\n",
      "“Among America’s most highly successful entrepreneurs, 76% never used VC,” Rao said. “Of the remaining 24% that did use VC, the majority were able to maintain control of their venture and the wealth they created by avoiding VC until their venture’s potential and their leadership skills were evident – when venture capitalists came calling.”\n",
      "This type of start-up financing and venture know-how, Rao says, is critical to entrepreneurs in Miami and other areas outside of Silicon Valley, where venture capital is scarce and has not been as successful. His experiences in financing and managing ventures in Minnesota and Wisconsin bears this out.\n",
      "Rao, who initially financed ventures using early-stage venture capital changed his perspective after researching how companies such as Fastenal, Best Buy, and UnitedHealthcare optimized internal financing to attract external financing and to take-off without VC. “My goal is to reach entrepreneurs with guidance that comes ‘straight from the unicorn’s mouth,’ ” he said. This expertise can help entrepreneurs and regions outside Silicon Valley build growth ventures by taking off without VC.\n",
      "Finance Secrets of Billion-Dollar Entrepreneurs is the first book published by FIU Business Press, a new imprint designed to bring resources for business success to a wide audience.\n",
      "FIU Business Press was created as an imprint of Mango Publishing of Coral Gables. Led by industry veteran Chris McKenney, Mango was ranked No.1 on Publishers Weekly’s 2019 and 2020 lists of the fastest-growing independent book publishers. Modeled after Harvard Business Press as a university-based publisher that caters to general business readers, FIU Business Press is an extension of FIU Business Executive Education and its mission to extend lifelong learning beyond the classroom.\n",
