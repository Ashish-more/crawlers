      "\t\t\t\t\tCreative Bioarray announced the release of its comprehensive CABR chromosome probes in order to improve chromosome studies.\n",
      "New York, USA  April 1, 2021  Creative Bioarray, the worlds leading biotechnology company focuses on offering high quality products and services including cell services, biosample services and histology services to accelerate life science research, help scientist solve complex analytical issues. Recently, Creative Bioarray announced the release of its comprehensive CABR chromosome probes in order to improve chromosome studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creative Bioarray provides the most comprehensive list of CABR probes, which can be used for a wide range of applications in related areas, such as detecting gene amplification, deletion, translocation and chromosomal aneuploidy related to tumor and genetic disease spectrum; this enables molecular diagnosis Technology is very important for clinical diagnostics and the pharmaceutical industry.\n",
      "Currently, Creative Bioarray has a full set of DNA probe libraries for specific chromosomes (whole chromosomes, specific chromosomal arms or chromosome fragments) that are fluorescently labeled. DNA is prepared by chromosome staining, and then the probe is hybridized to mitosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (chromosome separation). After the hybridization is completed, a multi-color coating effect will be produced at the hybridization site. Then, researchers can observe the fluorescence intensity on the chromosomes under a fluorescence microscope to analyze and study chromosome recombination, aberrations, and homologous genes.\n",
      "Centromeric probes can be combined with the centromeric regions of specific chromosomes to measure the number and type of specific chromosomes. The centromere probe binds to the repetitive alpha satellite DNA sequence. The repetitive sequence of DNA is different from other DNA, which is tightly wound throughout the cell cycle.\n",
      "Subtelomere-specific probes have been used to focus on specific subtelomere regions and have been developed in the research of new disease syndromes. Subtelomere-specific probes can also be used for research on autism, recurrent miscarriage and other aspects. CABR satellite enumeration probes specifically identify highly repetitive DNA sequences in 24 human chromosomes. These highly repetitive DNA sequences exist in the centromeres, centromeres and heterochromatin regions of chromosomes.\n",
      "Our chromosome probe products are highly specific and sensitive in identifying human pathology, and centromere probes can be used to detect single or aneuploid chromosomes, and can also be used as reference probes for other genes. said Hannah Cole, the marketing director of Creative Bioarray, she also added, Our subtelomere-specific probes are selected from the unique sequences at the end to obtain the most possible chromosome specificity, which can be used for routine subtelomere enumeration and integrity testing. We are pleased to provide our customers with high-quality chromosome probes to meet different needs.\n",

      "New York, USA  April 1, 2021  Capstone Hill Search (www.capstonehillsearch.com), the leading multinational talent agency speciating in corporate, marketing, and integrated communications and public relations, today released the findings of a new global study revealing how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected hiring in communications and PR. The findings of the study show that employers expect a market rebound while communications workers lack of market confidence might signal a lack of candidate movement making it harder for employers to attract new hires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Capstone Hill Search survey, published in a report entitled, The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Employment in the Communications Industry, polled senior communications and public relations executives from Fortune 500 and leading public and private companies around the world to better understand the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on hiring in 2021.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, the survey revealed a seismic shift in hiring trends and working environment during 2020, with nearly three-quarters of all communications employers reducing headcount and nearly all implementing work from home programs. However, optimism for 2021 and beyond seems to be strong, with 63% of communications employers intending to grow staff numbers by between 10%-40% in 2021 alone. Further, 88% of employers also felt positive about market outlook throughout 2021.\n",
      "Interestingly there are some noticeable differences of opinion between employers and employees; expectations seem to be most at odds on factors such as remuneration as well as timing and scale of return to work.\n",
      "Key findings from the survey include:\n",
      " 49% of those surveyed said they only experienced a minor reduction in revenue in 2020 70% indicated the pandemic had a minimal impact on headcount 78% intend to continue or expand remote work programs 63% of companies are planning to increase their headcount 58% have continued to hire workers, and 28% have started rehiring in Q1 2021 45% of workers said their primary concern in 2021 was job security\n",
      "Business has been universally impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and while the impact on communications employment during 2020 was very broad, it appears that it was not as deep as many predicted. The market is also indicating strong confidence that recovery and growth is returning quickly in 2021, said Jeremy Wrench, CEO of Capstone Hill Search.\n",
      "The optimism indicated in the surveys findings mirrors the resurgence in demand were seeing from the industry, albeit with significant shifts in the acceptance of remote and contract workers, said Matthew Ver Bruggen, President of Capstone Hill Search.\n",
      "At the same time, however employees continue to be nervous about jobs security and are hesitant to make a change. As the survey suggests and as we are witnessing anecdotally, demand is outstripping supply of talent willing to transition roles. This may well play out as employers predict placing more upward pressure on remuneration packages.\n",
