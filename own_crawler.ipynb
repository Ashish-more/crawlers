      "Naypyidaw, Myanmar  (CNN)\"This is not a coup,\" said Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun from a gilded hall in Myanmar's purpose-built capital Naypyidaw, the city where his comrades recently ousted an elected government, detained the country's leadership, and installed a military junta.During an hour-long conversation with CNN, the military spokesperson was steadfast in upholding the junta's official narrative: that the generals are merely \"safeguarding\" the country while they investigate a \"fraudulent\" election. The bloodshed on the streets that has killed at least 600 people is the fault of \"riotous\" protesters, he said. At one point, Zaw Min Tun said if civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi's father -- the assassinated independence hero Aung San, who founded the country's modern military -- could see the situation now, he would say: \"You are such a fool, my daughter.\"The interview took place during a week-long press tour of Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, and Naypyidaw from March 31 to April 6. Prior to the trip, the military assured CNN it would be able to report independently and be given freedom of movement, but the journalists' request to stay in a Yangon hotel was denied and the team instead were housed in a walled military compound, given only intermittent and heavily controlled access to the public.Major General Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson for the Myanmar military, at the Defense Services Museum in Naypyidaw, Myanmar on April 4, 2021.The following interview with Zaw Min Tun offers an insight into how Myanmar's military junta are trying to justify their bloody takeover to the world, while at the same time cocooning themselves in government buildings far from a populace fiercely resistant to their rule, as they order deadly crackdowns on their own citizens in villages, towns and cities across the country. Read MoreCNN was provided with military interpreters, but conducted its own translations afterward.The back storyHours after commander-in-chief of Myanmar's armed forces Gen. Min Aung Hlaing ordered his troops to seize the capital before dawn on February 1, he announced on television that a state of emergency would be in place for one year, after which elections would be held. His takeover came as newly-elected lawmakers were due to take their places on the opening day of parliament. The state of emergency caused all legislative, executive, and judicial power to be transferred to Min Aung Hlaing.Zaw Min Tun said the state of emergency could be extended for an additional \"six months or more\" over \"two terms\" and \"if the duties are not done yet.\" He did not give a firm date for when elections would be held, but said that according to the 2008 military-drafted constitution, \"we have to finish everything within two years. We have to hold a free and fair election within these two years.\"\"We promise that we will make it happen,\" he said. Myanmar's Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on March 27.Many observers have questioned whether the military, which ruled Myanmar for half a century between 1962 and 2011, would be willing to relinquish power again, whether elections would indeed be \"free and fair\" -- and whether ousted leader Suu Kyi and her popular party the National League for Democracy (NLD) would be allowed to contest. Zaw Min Tun pointed to a string of reforms the quasi-civilian government embarked upon in 2011 after the military gave up direct rule, which paved the way for the 2015 elections, in which Suu Kyi won a resounding victory. \"If we didn't want her from the beginning there would be no process like this,\" he said. However, the 2008 constitution was designed so the military would retain power despite a civilian government. It allocated the military a quarter of seats in parliament, giving it effective veto power over constitutional amendments, and the generals kept control of three powerful ministries -- defense, border and home affairs.Myanmar&#39;s military is waging war on its citizens. Some say it&#39;s time to fight back Zaw Min Tun also highlighted that Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest and has not been seen in public since the coup, is facing five charges, including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios, and for breaking Covid-19 regulations. She has also been accused of corruption and bribery. The most serious charge, however, is violating violating the country's Official Secrets Act, which carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.\"What happened is because of the corruptions on national level and errors on state level procedures and we are accusing on the facts,\" Zaw Min Tun said. \"Daw Aung San Su Kyi is a well-known person both in Myanmar and the world and we will not accuse that person without any reason.\"But slapping perceived opponents with charges under vaguely-worded colonial-era laws has been a well-used tool by the military throughout its rule, and during the reform period. The charges against Suu Kyi have been described as \"trumped up\" by her lawyer, who called the bribery accusations a \"complete fabrication.\"To justify the coup, the junta has alleged widespread election fraud in the November vote that would have given the NLD a second term and a mandate to continue its reform agenda, which included attempts to amend the constitution to limit the military's power. Zaw Min Tun said the military had tried to negotiate with the NLD government but \"no action was taken.\" Photos: Aung San Suu KyiAung San Suu Kyi poses for a portrait in Yangon, Myanmar, in 2010.

The election commission denied there was mass voter fraud and independent election monitors said there were no substantial problems that would be enough to overturn the result. Suu Kyi won with 83% of the vote. Bloodshed on the streetsIt is evident from the interview that Myanmar's military leaders want the world to believe they are acting in line with the country's laws and constitution, and say they are committed to building a \"multi-party democratic county.\" But the bloodshed on the streets, in which soldiers and police have shot dead protesters, bystanders and children, belies that claim. At least 600 civilians have been killed by security forces, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The UN envoy has reported enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture in prisons. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said authorities have \"increasingly resorted to heavy weaponry such as rocket-propelled and fragmentation grenades, heavy machine guns, and snipers to kill demonstrators in massive numbers.\"A police officer aims a gun during clashes with protesters taking part in a demonstration against the military coup in Naypyidaw on February 9.Around 3,000 people have been detained, many kept out of contact from their families, their condition or whereabouts unknown. Meanwhile, protesters, activists, journalists and families of those killed by the junta, have been forced into hiding as they fear security forces will hunt them in nighttime raids.   On Wednesday, a special envoy of Myanmar's ousted civilian government to the UN warned of a civil war if the world fails to stop the junta from seizing power and killing pro-democracy protesters.  \"The bloodbath is real. It is coming, more people will die. I am afraid,\" Dr. Sasa said on CNN. \"It is the time for the world to prevent another genocide, another ethnic cleansing, another massacre, so the world has the power to stop it before it's too late.\"Myanmar&#39;s military is killing peaceful protesters. Here&#39;s what you need to knowZaw Min Tun blamed the violence on protesters \"provoking\" the crowd and said security forces cracked down because protesters \"blocked the civil servants\" from going to work. In reality, thousands of civil servants, as well as white- and blue-collar workers, including medics, bankers, lawyers, teachers, engineers and factory workers, left their jobs as a form of resistance against the coup. The strikes, called the Civil Disobedience Movement, have disrupted sectors of the economy. \"The crowds were throwing stones and slingshots at them in the beginning but later the crowd are blocking with sand bags, shooting with handmade guns, throwing with fire, throwing with molotov (cocktails) and the security forces have to use the weapons for the riot,\" Zaw Min Tun said. Asked whether he was seriously comparing slingshots to assault rifles, Zaw Min Tun said the security forces were using \"minimum force.\" \"There will be deaths when they are cracking down (on) the riots, but we are not shooting around without discipline,\" he said. Protesters gather to demonstrate against the February 1 military coup, in downtown in Yangon on February 8.According to the military, the death toll at the time of the interview was 248 people, including 10 police officers and six soldiers, he said -- less than half the toll documented by multiple human rights groups, which have repeatedly said security forces are violating international humanitarian law by shooting indiscriminately into crowds of peaceful protesters. Bullet wounds in the heads and necks of many of those shot also suggest the soldiers are shooting to kill. Video and images captured by local journalists and eyewitnesses and verified by CNN show security forces shooting into crowds. In others, security forces are beating detainees with their rifles, or dragging bodies through the streets. The killing of childrenAccording to the UN Children's Fund, 46 children have been killed since the coup. CNN has documented instances of children being shot in their homes or while playing outside. When asked about three teenagers who have died at the hands of security forces -- Kyaw Min Latt, 17, Htoo Myat Win, 13, and Tun Tun Aung, 14, -- the military spokesperson blamed protesters for \"using\" children on the front lines. \"In some places they provoke the children to participate in violence riots ... Because of that they may get hit when the security forces were cracking down (on) the crowds,\" he said. \"There is no reason we will shoot the children, this is only the terrorists are trying to make us look bad.\"He said it was \"not possible\" that a child would be shot inside their house and an investigation would be carried out if that was the case. Videos posted on social media corroborate that security forces have shot at houses. Grieving family of young girl shot dead by Myanmar&#39;s military forced into hidingHtoo Myat Win's father said his son was shot when several bullets smashed a glass window in his house in Shwebo city on March 27. \"I dodged the bullet but my son was coming up to the glass window and got hit,\" he said, adding that his son was hit in the chest. \"I don't understand why they have to shoot us when we were inside our house.\"\"They were shooting at protesters before and the protesters were running and we hid some of them because we worried that they might get arrested. They (army) must have positioned themselves in this neighborhood,\" he said.  Video widely circulated online showed Htoo Myat Win's distraught father screaming with grief in the back of a taxi as he rushed to his son's lifeless body for help. Forced to go to a military hospital, Htoo Myat Win's father said doctors there did an autopsy and told him to sign a document stating there was no bullet. \"I asked them my son die with a bullet wound why you want to say it is not from a bullet?\" he said. Perhaps keen to avoid creating martyrs, the military has sought to control the narrative over some high-profile deaths. Junta forces exhumed the body of one young protester and carried out an autopsy in which they determined the bullet that killed her did not come from a police gun. The wife of Phoe Chit, a protester who died during a demonstration against the military coup on March 3, cries over the coffin of her husband during his funeral in Yangon on March 5.In another incident, a military hospital claimed Kyaw Min Latt died after falling off his motorbike in Dawei city. CCTV footage, however, captured the moment a soldier standing on the back of a truck shot at the teenager as he rode with two others, who managed to run away. His mother verified the footage to CNN. \"The doctor told us that my son is suffering from the injuries of fall from motorbike, we couldn't say back anything except just kept say yes to everything,\" his mother Daw Mon Mon Oo said. She said X-rays of her son's body conducted at a second hospital were taken away by officials from the military-run hospital. His death certificate, seen by CNN, states Kyaw Min Latt died on March 30 because of \"the primary brain injury due to the fall from cycle (motorcycle).\"When his family were able to take his body home, his mother said \"there was no injury from the fall of the bike but only when there the bullet went in and out, and bruised on his right eye.\"sPressed by CNN about the allegations from families of soldiers shooting into houses and of the military attempting to cover up the causes of deaths, spokesperson Zaw Min Tun demanded CNN show him evidence. \"If that kind of thing occurred, we will have investigation for it,\" he said. \"There may be some videos which look suspicious but for our forces, we don't have any intention to shoot at innocent people.\"It is unclear whether the military has launched any internal investigations into repeated claims of extrajudicial killings.She was shot dead, her body dug up and her grave filled with cement. But her fight is not overCNN also pressed Zaw Min Tun on why at least 11 people were detained shortly after speaking with the CNN team in Yangon. Some were detained merely for flashing the three-finger salute from the Hunger Games movies that has become a symbol of resistance. According to three sources close to those detained, who spoke on condition of anonymity over fears of reprisal, eight were later released. Zaw Min Tun confirmed security forces detained three people from the first market and eight others at a second after interacting with the team on the ground. When asked by CNN what crime they had committed, he said they hadn't broken the law.\"The security forces were worried they would provoke others and start the protest in the market, and that is why they got arrested,\" he said, adding the military expressed \"regret\" over the arrests.CNN has since learned those eight are now in hiding, fearing rearrest. International reactionThe coup and subsequent deadly crackdown have been widely condemned internationally. The United States, United Kingdom and European Union have imposed sanctions on several generals in charge of the coup, as well as on military-owned companies. However, while Zaw Min Tun insisted elections would be held in the future, he warned the military's version of democracy would perhaps not be a Western-style liberal system. \"The democratic country we are building is the one suitable with our history and geography. The standard of democracy in Myanmar will not be the same as from Western counties,\" he said. Despite the dangers, protesters from all walks of life in Myanmar continue to demand the military hand back power to civilian control and are held fully accountable. They continue to call for the release of Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders. Myanmar's many ethnic minority groups, which have long fought for greater autonomy for their lands, are also demanding the military-written 2008 constitution be abolished and a federal democracy be established.Having grown up with a level of democracy, and political and economic freedoms their parents and grandparents didn't have, Myanmar's young people leading the resistance movement remain determined to fight for what they see as their future -- and they say they will not give up.\n",

      "(CNN)Last year, more than 43,400 politicians in Brazil declared themselves to be a different race than in previous election years.Since 2014, Brazil has required electoral candidates to declare their \"color/race,\" picking from among \"Black,\" \"White,\" \"Brown,\" \"Yellow,\" and \"Indigenous.\" A CNN analysis of data published by the Electoral Justice, which organizes elections, shows that one in four candidates who ran for office in a previous election declared a different \"color/race\" in 2020 from previous such filings.The changes in politicians' self-identification reflect Brazil's rich diversity and mirror the country's evolving view on how to recognize and define demographic categories throughout its history. They also coincide with a new electoral rule that directs additional funding and visibility to Black and Brown candidates' campaigns.Interviews with several Brazilian candidates revealed a range of reasons for race changes -- some said they or campaign officials had simply made a mistake while filling their candidacy form, some said their family background gave them a claim to multiple racial groups, and some said they had recently started to feel a sense of belonging in a new racial category.Brazilian politicians do \"have some latitude to fluctuate on how they present themselves\" in order to connect with supporters, Andrew Janusz, a political scientist at the University of Florida who has studied the race changes of candidates extensively, told CNN. Nevertheless, \"individuals don't have total freedom of choice, so if someone is really fair-skinned, they might not be able to say that they are Black, for example,\" he said.Read MoreOfficial demographic categories in Brazil have traditionally focused on what demographers call marca -- each individual's external appearance -- rather than family origins, unlike the US.I could say that I&#39;m Parda because my grandmother was Black. But my color is White.Adriana GuimarãesThe most common racial change for politicians last year was from White to Black or Brown, a shift made by more than 17,300 candidates. But vast numbers of candidates also moved in the opposite direction: About 14,500 switched from Black or Brown to White -- the second-most common change.Adriana Collares, who ran for city council in Porto Alegre, told CNN that her racial declaration changed only because her previous party had mistakenly described her as White in 2016, against her wishes. \"I never considered myself White, but there was no name for what I was,\" she says. \"I never felt like I had the right to call myself Black. I was always recognized as 'tanned,' as 'mulatta,' as anything but Black. Then came this term, 'Pardo,' and I found my place in the world.\"\"Pardo\" translates literally to \"Brown,\" but can also mean mixed-race. Though not commonly used colloquially among Brazilians, it has been used by national statistics agency IBGE, including in the census, as an official category since the 1950s, and is currently the largest group in Brazil.Since the 2016 election, Collares left her old party and moved to a new one. In the 2020 election, she again requested to be described as Brown. This time, the party respected her choice.In contrast, Adriana Guimarães, who ran for city council in Manaus, switched her racial declaration in the opposite direction. She told CNN that she selected Brown in 2016 after being ideologically conditioned by the left. \"In Brazil, we have a mixture of races. In my case, I also have that mixture, of Black, White, and Indigenous. But under Lula and Dilma, there was a push for Brazilians to identify as Brown,\" she said, referring to campaigns sponsored by the administrations of former presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff that described Brazil as a mixed-race nation.After an economic crisis and a corruption scandal hit the country in the early 2010s, Guimarães, like many other  Brazilians, began to embrace a more conservative view of the world. She was also reacting to what she perceived as government overreach in the private sphere. \"I started participating in conservative movements,\" she says. \"I started researching conservatism, reading about Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom, and I ended up noticing that I'm conservative.\"She also noticed her racial identity in a new way. \"My race change happened due to my new political ideology,\" says Guimarães, now a supporter of President Jair Bolsonaro.In 2020, she declared herself White.\"I could say that I'm Parda because my grandmother was Black. But my color is White. My color is not Parda. I'm not a 'neutral burned Yellow.' I believe that saying that I'm Parda is like saying that I'm neutral. But I have my position, I have my strength, I'm not neutral. It's the same thing with that neutral gender. It's like being undecided,\" she said.Picking an identityBrazil's official racial categories have evolved over time, and some contemporary efforts to change them are part of a broader push to rectify inequalities rooted in the country's history. Slavery lasted longer in Brazil than in other places in the West, and involved more people than in other countries in the Americas -- of the 10.7 million slaves who arrived alive on the continent, about 5.8 million were brought to Brazil, compared to about 305,000 taken to the United States, according to the Slave Voyages database.\"Violence has characterized Brazilian history since the earliest days of colonization, marked as they were by the institution of slavery,\" write Heloisa Starling and Lilia Schwarcz in their history \"Brazil: A Biography\" Even after slavery ended, \"its legacy casts a long shadow.\" To this day, the country continues to suffer from steep social and racial inequality.Racism in Brazil is practiced through social constructions that exclude people by function of their physical characteristics, like skin color, facial features, and hair texture. That is what places people in their racial group, and not their genetic composition.Gabriela CruzWhile the nation shows \"cultural inclusion\" -- exemplified in diverse participation in popular traditions like samba, football, and capoeira -- they warn that \"social exclusion\" still means that \"the poor, and above all Black people, are the most harshly treated by the justice system, have the shortest life span, the least access to higher education, and to highly qualified jobs.\"That exclusion can be seen in politics too. According to the national statistics agency, Black and Brown people are the majority in Brazil, but in 2018 made up only about 40% of candidates for Congress. The disparity increased even more after the election -- only about 25% of successful candidates were Black or Brown, according to the Institute of Socioeconomic Studies, an independent research institute. Brazilian legislators elected in 2018 were overwhelmingly White.In the early 2000s, then-president da Silva created a government agency to promote racial equality, and in the early 2010s, his successor Rousseff approved ambitious affirmative action programs to address lingering racial inequality, including the 2012 law that reserves spots for poor, Black and Brown, and Indigenous students in federal universities and federal technical high schools, and the 2014 law that reserves 20% of public service jobs for Black and Brown applicants.These initiatives became rarer under the right-wing administration of later president Michel Temer and the current far-right administration of Bolsonaro. So progressive politicians have sought to advance social equality by pushing judges to interpret existing legislation, including the constitution, which repudiates racism.Putting money behind representation in politicsIn 2018, a group of female senators and deputies asked Brazil's Superior Electoral Court to rule on whether male and female candidates should receive funding and advertising proportionally.Judge Rosa Weber, who ruled in their favor, wrote in her decision that the Superior Electoral Court \"had been trying to encourage female participation in politics,\" but existing measures had not done enough. When it comes to funding and advertising, she wrote, proportionality mattered -- meaning that if a party has 30% of female candidates, those women should get 30% of the party's total allocated funds and 30% of its airtime. The new rule was approved in time for the 2018 federal election.Two years later, the same court received a similar inquiry from Benedita da Silva, a deputy in Congress and an iconic Black politician in Brazil, who asked the court if there should be a minimum quota for Black and Brown candidates within parties, and the same proportional mechanism for their funding and airtime. The court denied the quota, but approved the proportionality.These rules could make a significant difference in driving funds to some candidates from underrepresented groups and even increase their chances of being elected, says Luciana Ramos, a professor of law at Fundação Getúlio Vargas who has tracked the application and impact of the two new parity rules.Tracking how political parties manage their electoral decisions is relevant in Brazil because most party activities and electoral campaigns are publicly funded. In 2020, Brazilian political parties received a total of R$3 billion ($540 million) from national coffers.Politicians also get free airtime on television and radio. Last year, that was at least 1h30 per day distributed among parties for about 30 days before the election, according to figures published by the Electoral Justice.I owed this to my origins. I&#39;m absolutely a result of miscegenation.Marcio SouzaIn part because of the new racial equality rule, in part because of Black Lives Matter protests in Brazil and around the world, and in part because of growing awareness of racial inequality issues, more attention has been paid to the declarations of candidates in 2020 than in previous cycles.Some politicians are clearly sensitive to the scrutiny. Kelps Lima, who ran for mayor of Natal and declared himself as White in 2016 and Black in 2020, answered a broad question about his race change with a vigorous denial that it had anything to do with funding. \"I declare to be Black since always and I NEVER USED QUOTAS in any moment of my life,\" he wrote to CNN. \"In 2016, the party made a MISTAKE and declared me as WHITE.\" Lima added that he didn't use campaign funds reserved for Black and Brown candidates and said that he had declared to be Black in two previous elections.A small portion of politicians who changed race in 2020 had made consistent declarations until that year: CNN's analysis identified about 360 candidates who declared themselves White for two or three elections, between 2014 and 2018, then changed their race to Black or Brown as the new racial equality rule came into force in 2020.\"I owed this to my origins,\" said Marcio Souza, a candidate for city council in Porto Alegre who identified as White in two previous elections before changing to Black. \"I'm absolutely a result of miscegenation,\" he wrote in an email to CNN. \"My mother was White, green eyes, Portuguese and Spanish, and my father was dark brown, dark brown eyes, Portuguese and Black.\"He says he made the change as a conscious statement of solidarity. \"For a long time, I have been thinking about this subject,\" he wrote. \"Due to the occurrences of racial crimes, I decided to adopt, in a positive manner, one of the elements of my racial composition, following my consciousness.\"\"From that decision, I didn't receive financial benefits,\" he added. \"I'm at peace and I believe to be contributing to the fight against racism.\"Another candidate, Vanderlan Cardoso, who ran for mayor of Goiânia, declared himself White for three consecutive elections, before selecting Brown in 2020.He gave a partial explanation for the race change during his electoral campaign last year, telling Goiás newspaper Popular that different people filled his candidacy forms. \"In 2018, whoever filled it considered that I'm White,\" he said. \"Whoever did it now, instead, thinks that I'm Brown.\" He also said during the campaign that he didn't plan to use funds reserved for Black and Brown candidates. Cardoso did not answer requests for comment from CNN that mentioned his 2014 and 2016 racial declarations.He lost the election and returned to his job in Brasília as a senator representing the state of Goiás. But the electoral data shows that tens of other candidates who made the same move from White to Black or Brown ended up winning their races, including mayors of state capitals.Verifying racial claimsCould Brazil's racial fluidity end up weakening affirmative action rules designed to bolster under-represented groups, when those rules depend on stable racial categories to work?\"Most everyone will say that racial inequality is a major issue in Brazil, and that things need to be done to ameliorate equality,\" says Janusz, the political scientist who studies the race changes. \"But to do that, you have to identify some boundaries, some procedures to identify beneficiaries.\"In other affirmative action systems in Brazil, commissions exist to check if people are telling the truth.They wanted to know if I had experienced life as a non-White person. I had to do an interview. I had to bring family photographs, childhood photographs.Adriana CollaresWhen Collares, the city council candidate from Porto Alegre, made use of the affirmative action programs approved under Lula and Dilma and took advantage of a racial quota to get her current job as a civil servant, she had to go through an interview with a commission that checked if she was really Brown. \"I believe they wanted to know if I had experienced life as a non-White person,\" she says. \"I had to do an interview. I had to bring family photographs, childhood photographs. They asked about my family life, the culture inside our house, family habits. I spoke a bit about my life. I thought it was kind of surreal, but fine.\"But political parties are not required to verify candidates' racial declarations, and multiple parties that spoke to CNN said they were unaware that their politicians had changed race.Both PT, the left-wing party of former presidents Lula and Dilma, and PSDB, the right-wing party of former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said that they had not recorded race changes among their candidates, even though the electoral data reveals thousands of changes in each party.Some parties benefitted candidates who had recently switched races. A list of Black and Brown candidates who received more funds due to the new rule sent to CNN by PSDB included one politician who had run for office as White in 2018 and as Brown in 2020. The party did not answer a question about that specific candidate. Gabriela Cruz, the leader of the Black wing of the PSDB party, told CNN she believed there might have been fraud in the 2020 election. \"I observed cases in which the self-declared person was White,\" she said, but added that making any further claims was complicated. \"I don't have enough evidence to say if it was only to access funds or if it was a question of racial awareness.\"Cruz thinks parties should be required to check candidates' physical traits against their racial declarations, \"with the support of the Black wing of the party.\" Though she respects people's self-identification, she argues that physical traits matter. \"Racism in Brazil is practiced through social constructions that exclude people by function of their physical characteristics, like skin color, facial features, and hair texture,\" she says. \"That is what places people in their racial group, and not their genetic composition.\"Ramos, the law professor studying the funding rules, says that there could have been instances of deceit in 2020, but noted that fraud could also take other forms. \"A party leader could direct campaign resources to a Black candidate and order her to transfer those resources to a White candidate, for instance,\" she said.The Superior Electoral Court told CNN that it has not received any reports of fraud from the 2020 vote so far, in part because parties are still making their campaign budgets public. It said that potential punishments would include forcing a candidate to return the funds used in the campaign and, in more serious cases, removing them from office.Brazil is changingRepresentation matters more and more as Brazil itself changes. Population data from the national statistics agency shows that the share of Brazilians declaring to be Black and Brown increased during the 2010s, and that now represent about 56% of the entire population. Meanwhile, the share of Brazilians declaring to be White fell -- they now make up 43%. Only recently have Brazilians had the option to declare their own racial identity -- historically, census interviewers assigned their subjects a racial category.But Brazil's political arena is failing to reflect the country's diversity, despite the new equality rules approved in 2018 and 2020. Ramos, the law professor, points to a preliminary tally by 72 Horas, a watchdog group, that shows that, based on the budgets that have been made public so far, parties failed to distribute support proportionally, either by race or gender.Parties gave only 42% of their available campaign funds to Black and Brown candidates in 2020, according to 72 Horas, even though they were 50% of all candidates, according to the statistics released by the Electoral Justice. And parties gave only 30% of their funds to female candidates, even though they were 33% of all candidates.Since both women and Black and Brown people are the majority in Brazil, the figures above suggest that they were underrepresented within parties in relation to their true size in the population, and that their campaigns were underfunded in relation to their size within parties.Closing the gap between genders and races is important if Brazil wants to create better policies for specific groups, says Collares, the city council candidate from Porto Alegre. She believes that when a politician belongs to a certain group, their work is informed by the life experience of being a member of that group. \"If you don't experience it in your life, if you don't feel it on your skin, it's difficult to understand, it's difficult to prioritize,\" she says. \"A man thinking policies for women is different from a woman thinking policies for women.\"\"We need to try to reach this parity, this representation,\" she adds. \"The majority of our people are Black and Brown, and we don't see that.\"\n",

      "New DelhiIndia's Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a plea to stop the government from deporting to Myanmar some 150 Rohingya Muslims police detained last month, paving the way for them to be sent to a country where hundreds have been killed following a military coup.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been trying to send back Rohingyas, a Muslim minority from Myanmar who have found refuge in India after fleeing persecution and waves of violence over the years.Two refugees petitioned the Supreme Court for the release of Rohingya refugees detained in the northern Jammu region last month, and to block the government from deporting them. Their plea argued that refugees in Jammu \"have been illegally detained and jailed in a sub-jail now converted into a holding center.\"India begins deporting more than 150 Rohingya refugees to MyanmarTheir petition added the Indian constitution -- which states that no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty -- by principle includes the concept of non-refoulement, which forbids the expulsion of refugees to a country where they are likely to be subjected to persecution.But Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde said the deportations could go ahead, as long as officials followed due process. Read More\"It is not possible to grant the interim relief prayed for,\" the judge said in his order. \"Regarding the contention raised on behalf of the petitioners about the present state of affairs in Myanmar, we have to state that we cannot comment upon something happening in another country.\"He added in the order that India is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees 1951, and that the principle of non-refoulement is only applicable to member states. Furthermore, he added, India's porous land borders results in a \"continuous threat of influx of illegal immigrants,\" which poses \"serious national security ramifications.\"\t\t\n",

      "India does not have legislation that specifically refers to refugees -- so Rohingya refugees are often labeled  illegal immigrants subject to deportation by the government under the Foreigners Act 1946 and the Foreigners Order 1948.Hundreds of people have been killed in Myanmar since the army seized power in a coup on February 1.The ruling has triggered panic among refugees in India, a Rohingya community leader in New Delhi told Reuters, declining to be named out of fear of reprisals.\"This is a terrifying order made by the highest court in India,\" he said. \"Given the horrifying situation in Myanmar, I had really hoped the judge would rule in our favour.\"The Modi government says the Rohingya are in the country illegally and are a security threat. At least a dozen Rohingya have been deported since 2017, according to community leaders.\n",

      "(CNN)A series of legal loopholes that prevent Australia's public servants -- including politicians and judges -- from being prosecuted for sexual harassment look like they are finally about to be closed following nearly 40 years on the statute books.The move comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison deals with the backlash over his handling of a string of allegations about the mistreatment of women in politics.On Thursday, Morrison said in a news conference the government plans to amend the Sex Discrimination Act under measures designed to tackle sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. He said he hoped to pass the new laws by the end of June.Morrison said sexual harassment was \"immoral and despicable and even criminal,\" and \"denies Australians, especially women, not just their personal security but their economic security by not being safe at work.\"The changes were recommended in a March 2020 report by Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins. It took the government more than one year to announce amendments to the act.Read MoreThe push to update the law comes with the country's political culture under scrutiny following a wave of allegations in the past two months of inappropriate sexual behavior in Parliament, including alleged harassment and rape.In February a former staffer in Morrison's ruling Liberal Party said she had been raped in 2019 by a colleague while inside Parliament House in Canberra. Three weeks later, then-Attorney General Christian Porter revealed he had been accused of raping a woman in the late 1980s, which he strongly denied.Morrison was strongly criticized for his response to the allegations. On March 15, thousands of women across Australia marched in protest to call for an end to violence against women and greater protections against sex crimesZali Steggall, an independent federal politician and lawyer, said the proposed changes to the law were a positive step, but she called on the government to make the changes quickly.\"The longer the delay is, the longer the behavior is not caught, and this is not retrospective legislation so it needs to be passed as soon as possible,\" she said.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia on 8 April.How the loopholes were createdAustralia's Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1984.In a review of the law for the UNSW Law Journal on its 20th anniversary in 2004, Australian discrimination law expert Beth Gaze described it as \"hesitant and rather ambivalent.\"Gaze told CNN that under the Sex Discrimination Act, politicians and judges are not covered as they don't fall within the areas of employment where the legislation prohibits discrimination -- leaving them outside the protections of the act How rape allegations among Australia&#39;s political elite reignited its #MeToo movementPoliticians' staffers are covered under separate employment legislation, Gaze said, which doesn't include sex discrimination protections.Legal experts said the loopholes in the law were likely the result of outdated and poorly worded legislation, rather than an attempt to deliberately protect Australian politicians from accusations of sexual harassment.Federal politician Steggall said the original wording of the 1984 Act had been proscriptive, trying to lay out every type of workplace where discrimination or harassment could occur, rather than issuing a blanket ban. The wording of the legislation led to confusion and gray areas.The original law \"reflected the time in which it was created,\" President of the Law Council of Australia, Dr. Jacoba Brasch, said in a statement. \"Australian culture and attitudes have moved on, and the SDA needs to be updated to reflect the contemporary expectations of the public,\" she said.Steggall said the loopholes had first been identified during an inquiry in the Australian Senate in 2008 but had taken more than a decade to fix, with blame falling on \"all sides of politics for failing to act.\"What's in the amendments?Morrison said Thursday he would adopt all 55 of the recommendations made by the commissioner, including a blanket ban on sex discrimination in the workplace and a national survey every four years to check on progress.The government's proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act would also make it clearer for employers and employees on what constitutes gender discrimination, and give complainants longer to file.But despite Morrison's June timelime, Steggall said she had drafted new laws that were ready to be introduced once Parliament resumes in May. Her legislation would close the loopholes in the Sex Discrimination Act and sexual harassment in all circumstances, she said. The law would also penalize organizations or political parties that aid or abet in the crime. Brasch said the success of any legislation introduced by the Morrison government would depend on how the new laws were worded, to erase any \"ambiguity\" in the legislation and ensure public servants were \"personally liable\" for sexual harassment.\"(This is) key to ensuring that (the problem) is appropriately addressed, and that problematic conduct does not fall into regulatory gaps,\" she said.\n",

      "(CNN)A Japanese woman whose lungs were severely damaged by Covid-19 has received what doctors say is the world's first lung transplant from living donors to a recovered coronavirus patient. Kyoto University Hospital said the woman underwent an 11-hour operation by a 30-strong medical team on Wednesday to transplant lung tissue from her husband and son.X-ray images show the patient's chest before the transplant operation, left, and after, right. The dark areas indicate where lung tissue has been transplanted. Covid-19 is known to cause severe lung damage in some patients, and people around the world -- including the United States -- have received lung transplants as part of their recovery from the disease.But the Kyoto hospital said this case was the first in which lung tissue had been transplanted from living donors to a Covid-19 patient. Dr. Hiroshi Date, a thoracic surgeon at the hospital who led the operation, said it gave hope to patients suffering from severe lung damage from Covid-19.Read More\"We demonstrated that we now have an option of lung transplants (from living donors),\" he said at a Thursday news conference. The patient, identified only as a woman from Japan's western region of Kansai, contracted Covid-19 late last year, and spent months on a life support machine that worked as an artificial lung, according to Kyoto University Hospital. Covid-19 caused so much damage to her lungs they were no longer functional, and she required a lung transplant to live.The woman's husband and son offered to donate parts of their lungs. Transplants from brain-dead donors are still rare in Japan, and live donors are considered a better option, according to the hospital's statement.Japanese doctors perform a lung transplant on a Covid-19 patient. The husband and son are in a stable condition and the woman remains in intensive care. She's expected to be able to leave the hospital in about two months, according to the hospital.In June last year, US surgeons performed a successful double lung transplant on a Covid-19 patient -- believed to be the first such operation on a coronavirus patient in the country. Last month, US surgeons completed a \"Covid to Covid\" double lung transplant, using lungs from a donor who recovered from Covid-19, only to die from another cause, for a patient in his 60s whose lungs were damaged by the disease. A study released earlier this year of more than 1,700 patients treated in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- ground zero of the pandemic --  found that X-rays of severely ill patients showed evidence of lung damage months after their infection.\n",

      "Seoul (CNN)South Korea unveiled its homegrown supersonic jet fighter on Friday, joining an exclusive club of military aviation giants and setting the stage for a $5.2 billion program it hopes will be a top export driver and jobs creator.Once operational, the KF-21 jet is expected to be armed with a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles -- and possibly even air-launched cruise missiles. The twin-engine fighters will come in single- and two-seat versions, depending on the missions to which they are tasked.\"A new era of independent defense has begun, and it's a historic milestone in the development of the [South Korean] aviation industry,\" President Moon Jae-in said at the rollout of the KF-21, nicknamed Boramae, or \"young hawk trained for hunting,\" at the production plant of Korea Aerospace Industries in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang province.Moon said after ground and flight tests are completed, mass production of the KF-21 will begin with a goal of 40 jets deployed by 2028 and 120 by 2032.Read More\"When full-scale mass production begins, 100,000 additional jobs will be created and we'll have an added value of 5.9 trillion Korean won ($5.2 billion). The effect will be much greater if they're exported,\" Moon said.South Korea is expected to produce six KF-21 prototypes for testing and development, the first three to be completed by the end of this year and the next three in the first half of 2022, according to the country's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). The KF-21 on the production line in South Korea earlier this year.Exclusive clubWhile only 65% of the KF-21 is of South Korean origin, its rollout still marks a significant achievement for a country that doesn't have a lengthy history of aircraft production.\"When the final tests are completed in the future, South Korea will become the eighth country in the world that has developed an advanced supersonic fighter,\" a government statement said.Those countries are the United States, Russia, China, Japan, France, Sweden and a European consortium of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain. Of those, only the United States and China have deployed domestic-made fifth-generation fighter jets -- planes which feature stealth technologies, radar-jamming capabilities and advanced avionics that integrate onboard and remote data to give pilots a complete real-time picture of their operation, according to NATO's Joint Air Power Competence Center.While the DAPA calls the KF-21 a 4.5-generation fighter jet because it lacks, for instance, an internal weapons bay that increases stealthiness, analysts say it may be able to fly higher and faster than the newest US-made fifth-generation fighter, the F-35, and still carry a robust weapons load.\"The KF-21 is the first fighter aircraft made with domestic technology, and it indicates that South Korea is now able to build fighter aircraft by its own. It will also be a stepping stone to develop better fighter aircraft and operate locally developed arms,\" a DAPA statement to CNN said.The KF-21 is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia in which Seoul holds 80% of shares while Jakarta seeks 20%. South Korea says Indonesia is behind in payments to the project, but negotiations continue and Jakarta's defense minister was at Friday's rollout. A handout photo released by KAI shows workers of Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) assemble the first prototype of South Korea's indigenous fighter jet at its plant in the southeastern city of Sacheon, South Korea in January.Moon saluted Indonesia for its role. \"In particular, I thank the Indonesian government for becoming a partner who believed in the potential of South Korea,\" he said. The new fighter jet is expected to replace South Korea's F-4 and F-5 fighters, third-generation US-designed jets first introduced in the 1960s.As production runs are increased, it could also replace South Korea's fourth-generation F-16s and F-15Ks, analyst Abraham Ait, chief editor of Military Watch Magazine, wrote in The Diplomat last year.South Korea also operates F-35 stealth fighters, receiving the first in a 40-jet order in 2018.Overseas salesWhile the KF-21 might eventually replace hundreds of fighter jets in South Korea's fleet, it also has significant export potential because its price tag is expected to be significantly lower than the F-35s the US sells to foreign militaries.Thailand, the Philippines, and possibly even Iraq \"could be leading clients for the fighter,\" Ait wrote, noting those countries all operate the same kind of aircraft the KF-21 will replace in South Korea's fleet. They also have been customers for South Korea's indigenously developed FA-50 light-attack fighter.If Seoul is successful in marketing the KF-21 as an export product, it will continue a trend for South Korea. According to statistics from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Seoul's arms exports were 210% higher from 2016 to 2020 than in the previous five years -- giving South Korea a 2.7% share of the world's global arms market.Government spokesperson Lim Se-eun said Thursday South Korea plans to build its own surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, electronic warfare ability, enhance its air defenses, build stronger guided weapons, and secure an independent satellite navigation system and space war capability -- all with the goal of being in the top seven nations in the global aviation industry by 2030.\n",

      "(CNN)Joe Manchin says it's no fun being the most powerful man in Washington.The West Virginia Democrat, who sits at the fulcrum of the Senate balance of power, suggested the US Capitol insurrection was a warning for him -- of the divisions tearing America apart and the dangers wrought by politicians who abuse their power.\"Something told me, 'Wait a minute. Pause. Hit the pause button.' Something's wrong. You can't have this many people split to where they want to go to war with each other,\" Manchin told CNN's Lauren Fox in an interview on Thursday.It might surprise some of his fellow Democrats, however, to learn that Manchin now appears to believe that the appropriate response to those horrific events is to prevent either side in the Senate from exerting their will over the other. If that means thwarting a bid to overturn supermajority filibuster rules in the Senate that could buckle Democratic dreams of a radical and historic Joe Biden presidency, that appears to be a risk he's willing to take. \"I've watched people that had power and abused it,\" Manchin said. \"I've watched people that sought power and destroyed themselves. And I've watched people that had a moment of time to make a difference and change things, and used it -- I would like to be that third.\"Read MoreBiden&#39;s First 100 DaysBiden's planned pick for ATF director a fierce advocate for gun controlWhite House defends hiking taxes on corporations to pay for infrastructure, signals openness to compromiseBiden administration reviewing 5,600 additional files for evidence of family separations under TrumpManchin makes his arguments as a Democrat from a conservative state that Donald Trump overwhelmingly carried twice. He's not just in a delicate personal position. He's the personification of a divided country, and -- as the crucial swing vote in a 50-50 Senate -- he's enormously consequential for Biden's agenda. After laying out a series of limited gun restrictions earlier Thursday, the President pleaded with Congress to pass gun control legislation following a spate of mass shootings. But Manchin wouldn't commit to a House-passed bill that would tighten background checks for firearms purchases. He also said he wanted to speak to Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock about federal voting rights legislation, following the passage of a sweeping election law in their home state of Georgia that discriminates against minority voters. He suggested he'd get Republicans to sit down with Democrats on an issue on which the two sides could hardly be farther apart.The power of Joe Manchin Asked whether he was enjoying his moment in the spotlight, Manchin said, \"No.\" But the pressure is nothing yet, since he -- and a small group of other more moderate Democratic senators -- could end up as the roadblock to ambitious Democratic plans for sweeping reforms of the electoral system partly designed to counter those Republican voter suppression tactics. The coal-state senator could block Biden's hopes to take the United States towards zero fossil fuel emissions. And if his reluctance to embrace the filibuster-dodging tactic of reconciliation stands, he could kill Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan that represents the second leg of the President's ambitious plan to remake the American economy.It is not clear at this point whether Manchin's positions are absolute -- or could be modified by events if, for instance, the Republicans with whom he wants Biden to compromise stonewall the President.Joe Manchin just crushed liberals&#39; dream for Joe Biden&#39;s first termManchin also made clear that he's been in frequent and apparently friendly contact with a President who knows something about giving those whose votes he needs the space and respect to reach their final positions. \"We've had a good friendship and relationship for a long time. We understand each other,\" Manchin told CNN. A turbulent and fateful political period is about to ensue during a months-long effort by the President to build public support for his infrastructure plan. How it turns out could shift the ground on which Manchin is assessing his own position. It's unknown whether Manchin's current stance will be sustainable should Biden's future bills prove as popular as the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill -- for which he voted. Disproportionate largesse sent West Virginia's way in the infrastructure package might offer Manchin a route to approving the legislation. It is too early to rule out the idea that he is maximizing the power that fate has handed him to advantage his constituents.It would also be quite a statement if he were to go down as the Democratic senator who effectively helped Republicans neuter a presidency born in a crisis that led to a sweet spot for fundamental political reform.\"I'm representing West Virginia to the best of my ability. And I'm trying to speak for my state,\" Manchin said in the interview.Trust in RepublicansAt times, it seems that Manchin is the most naïve man in Washington. He often appears to be operating in an idealized version of the capital that no longer exists. He is, after all, trying to force cooperation between Biden and Republicans who have clearly signaled -- even in the middle of a pandemic that has killed more than half a million Americans -- that they want nothing to do with anything that could give the President a win. And there appears to be no common ground between Democrats who believe Republicans are already acting to steal the next election with a flurry of state bills that narrow access to voting and Republicans who believe Democratic voter reform efforts in Washington amount to an unconstitutional power grab.But that's not how Manchin sees it, as he explained when justifying his refusal to kill the filibuster. Unless he recants, it would be impossible for federal voting rights legislation to pass over Republican opposition in the Senate.Manchin and the grim reality of Washington&#39;s minority rule\"I think we can find a pathway forward. I really do. I'm going to be sitting down with both sides in understanding where everybody is coming from,\" he said. \"We should have an open, fair and safe election. If we have to put guard rails on we can put guard rails on so people can't take advantage of people. And I believe there are Republicans that feel exactly like I feel.\"Again, many Democrats -- keen to take advantage of what could be a fleeting moment of power in Washington with their thin majorities in the House and Senate -- will be infuriated with Manchin's position.Yet he is acting perfectly within his rights. And Democrats in effect handed him that power with what many of them regard as a disappointing performance in congressional elections that fell well short of the standard Biden set when he beat Trump. And if it wasn't for a Democrat from West Virginia, who won reelection in 2018 in a Trump bastion, they'd be in the minority in the Senate.Still, Democrats may find the logic of Manchin's arguments about the Capitol insurrection hard to understand.\"January 6 changed me ... I never thought in my life, I never read in the history books to where our form of government had been attacked, at our seat of government, which is Washington, DC, at our Capitol, by our own people,\" Manchin told CNN. But his comment that people went \"to war with each other\" in January is difficult to parse, since the mob that attacked the Capitol was inspired by Trump's multiple lies about election fraud. There was only one side doing the attacking. As the country moves farther from January 6, Manchin's hot seat is only going to get more uncomfortable -- but for now at least, he's got no intention of vacating it.\n",

      "(CNN)A renowned pulmonary critical care doctor testified Thursday morning that George Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when former police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the street and restricted his ability to breathe.\"This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a PEA arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop,\" Dr. Martin Tobin of Chicago testified, referring to pulseless electrical activity, a type of cardiac arrest.\"The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing,\" he added. \"Small breaths. Small tidal volumes. Shallow breaths that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide.\"Related: Follow live updatesHe identified four main reasons why Floyd died: the handcuffs and the street acting as a \"vise;\" Chauvin's left knee on his neck; Floyd's prone position; and Chauvin's right knee on Floyd's back, arm and side. Combined, these limited Floyd's ability to expand his lungs and narrowed his hypopharynx, a part of the throat that air passes through.Read MoreFloyd's preexisting health conditions and drug use were not relevant to his death, Tobin said.\"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,\" he said.Lead investigator in Derek Chauvin case changes mind about what George Floyd said in videoTobin's testimony came on the ninth day of the trial as prosecutors shifted into the third phase of their case, focusing on the medical analysis of Floyd's cause of death. Also on Thursday, another doctor seconded Tobin's conclusion and a forensic toxicologist discussed the drugs found in Floyd's system.The first week of the trial focused on Floyd's last moments on May 25, 2020, particularly the harrowing bystander and body-camera footage that showed his final breaths. Over the last few days, a series of police experts and training coordinators have testified that Chauvin violated police policy and used excessive force on Floyd.The medical analysis is important to the prosecution's case that Chauvin was a substantial cause of Floyd's death when he put his body weight on Floyd's neck and back for over nine minutes -- causing death by \"positional asphyxia.\" Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson has argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose and preexisting health conditions.Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter. The trial, now in its second full week of testimony, is expected to last about a month.Floyd used knuckles to try to breathe, doctor saysDr. Martin Tobin said these still images from body-worn camera indicated that George Floyd pressed his knuckles against the squad car and the ground to try to open up his chest and breathe.Dr. Tobin highlighted several still images from the police body-cam footage that showed Floyd pressing his knuckles against the squad car's tire, pressing his fingers and knuckles against the ground, lifting his right shoulder and even digging his face into the street. These images indicated that Floyd was using every possible way to try to lift up his chest and breathe, Tobin said.\"It's a very poor way of breathing. But it's what you have to do when everything else is failing,\" he said.Prosecutors also played disturbing slow-motion video of what Tobin said was Floyd's final moment alive, as his eyes flickered and then closed.\"You can see his eyes, he's conscious, and then you see that he isn't. That's the moment the life goes out of his body,\" Tobin said.By observing Floyd's condition in video and calculating the rate of decline in his blood-oxygen level, Tobin deduced that Floyd eventually had no oxygen left in his body. Chauvin remained kneeling on him for another three minutes and two seconds after that point, he said.He highlighted a moment in the body-camera footage when Floyd's legs lift into the air. This involuntary movement, also known as an anoxic seizure, is evidence of a fatal brain injury due to lack of oxygen, Tobin said.With the demeanor of a kindly old professor, Tobin -- who wrote the textbook on mechanical ventilation -- spoke directly to the jury and encouraged them to feel parts of their own neck and chest as he described how breathing works. Almost all of the jurors did as the doctor asked and closely engaged with the testimony, according to a pool report from inside the courtroom.Chauvin kneeled for over 3 minutes after Floyd had no oxygen in his bodyDr. Martin Tobin testifies during the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin on April 8, 2021.Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for over 90% of the time, Tobin said. The doctor calculated that this constituted about 91.5 pounds on Floyd's neck when his feet came off the ground.Further, Tobin explained that fentanyl did not play a role in Floyd's death. After observing body-cam footage, Tobin calculated Floyd's respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute, within normal range. People who overdose on fentanyl generally have a respiratory rate of about 10, so Tobin concluded that fentanyl was not affecting Floyd's breathing.\"Basically it tells you that there isn't fentanyl on board that is affecting his respiratory centers. It's not having an effect on his respiratory centers,\" Tobin said.At the scene, former officer Tou Thao told the concerned bystanders that \"if you can speak, you can breathe.\" Tobin testified that comment is true but misleading and \"gives you an enormous false sense of security.\"Forensic pathologist: The real key to the Chauvin verdict\"Certainly, at the moment that you are speaking, you are breathing. But it doesn't tell you that you're going to be breathing five seconds later,\" the doctor said.On cross-examination, defense attorney Nelson, his voice growing hoarse, said he had only received Tobin's medical reports the night before. He struggled to make much headway against Tobin's expertise, though he did get Tobin to acknowledge that fentanyl's peak effect is about five minutes after ingestion.The most important medical testimony could come Friday when Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker is expected to testify. Baker performed the autopsy on Floyd and determined his death was a homicide, listing the cause of death as \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"However, Tobin indicated the autopsy may not be of much use in this case. Deaths from low oxygen don't \"leave a fingerprint\" on an autopsy, he said.Second doctor rejects excited deliriumDefense attorney Eric Nelson, left, and former police officer Derek Chauvin appear in court on April 8, 2021.Dr. Bill Smock, an emergency medicine physician and the police surgeon for the Louisville Metro Police, testified Thursday for the prosecution as a medical expert. He seconded Dr. Tobin's analysis of Floyd's cause of death.\"Mr. Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body,\" he said.Smock rejected the idea that Floyd died of \"excited delirium,\" a controversial diagnosis that is not recognized by either the American Psychiatric Association or the American Medical Association. Smock said he believes it is a real diagnosis -- but Floyd showed none of its 10 symptoms, such as taking off his clothes or failing to respond to questions.He similarly rejected the theory that Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose. People who overdose on fentanyl become listless and stop breathing, while Floyd was desperately trying to breathe.\"That is not a fentanyl overdose. That is somebody begging to breathe,\" he said.Toxicologists testify on drugs in Floyd's systemDaniel Isenschmid, a forensic toxicologist at NMS Labs who analyzed Floyd's blood, testified Thursday afternoon about the levels of drugs found in Floyd's blood after his death. Traumatizing details of George Floyd&#39;s death were shown in court. Experts weigh in on who should -- and shouldn&#39;t -- see themTesting found that Floyd had about 11 nanograms per milliliter of fentanyl in his blood. That is comparable to the level found in people arrested for DUI, but lower than the level found in people tested after death, Isenschmid said. The impact of fentanyl on someone can vary from person to person due to tolerance, he said.Floyd also had 19 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine in his system, a \"very low\" level, according to Isenschmid.A day earlier, jurors heard testimony that several white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's vehicle, and a smaller pill with Floyd's saliva on it was found in the back of the police squad car.\n",

      "New York (CNN Business)Bitcoin's soaring popularity could have a long-lasting negative effect on the environment.Cryptocurrency mining requires significant computer power and electricity, and the increase in bitcoin purchases leaves behind a hefty carbon footprint. But just how much is bitcoin mining contributing to global warming? In China alone, bitcoin is projected to generate more than 130 million metric tons of carbon emissions by the time the technology's energy consumption peaks in 2024, according to a new study published in the scientific journal Nature Communications. That amount of greenhouse gases would have surpassed the total annual emissions output from the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016. The bitcoin blockchain could consume as much energy per year as small to medium-sized countries such as Denmark, Ireland or Bangladesh, according to research from Sinan Kufeogl, civil engineering research associate at the University of Cambridge. Read MoreAs bitcoin has grown in popularity, China has become a mecca for the technology. If China's bitcoin industry were a country, its total energy consumption would have ranked 12th globally in 2016, ahead of major economies like Italy and Saudi Arabia, according to the study. With specialized hardware and cheap electricity readily available, the country now accounts for more than 75% of the bitcoin network's hashing power — the power a computer or hardware uses to run and solve algorithms that generate new cryptocurrency sums and allow transactions between them.\"Since the bitcoin mining industry is so new, it has not been properly accounted for and regulated around the world,\" Shouyang Wang, a co-author of the study and professor at Chinese Academy of Sciences, told CNN Business.Bitcoin mining hardware has evolved as the cryptocurrency's popularity has increased over time. At its inception, bitcoin mining went through a basic Central Processing Unit (CPU) on a general-purpose computer, the study's authors say.The process then evolved and shifted to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which offered more power, higher hash rates and ultimately led to more energy consumption. Eventually, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) were introduced to optimize the mining-related calculations. Cryptocurrency mining hardware is constantly running, which also increases energy consumption. Between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018, the mining operations for four major cryptocurrencies released up to an estimated 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to a separate study in the research journal Nature Sustainability. The growth of these emissions could have massive implications for the entire planet. China is a key signatory of the Paris Agreement and has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060. But the country remains the world's largest contributor of greenhouse gases, and the study's authors say bitcoin mining could compromise the country's attempts at emissions reductions.\"It is important to provide miners with incentives to move their operations to clean-energy regions,\" Wang said. \"That is why building and upgrading the clean-energy power generation facilities to ensure consistent electricity generation is important.\"\n",

      "(CNN)Two Venezuelan mayors are in hot water after marking the houses of potential Covid-19 patients with warning signs -- a measure that has been harshly criticized by civil rights NGOs and has prompted an investigation by Venezuela's attorney general. In a video posted on his official Instagram account on Tuesday, Mayor Luis Adrian Duque of Guama, a small village in the central Venezuelan state of Yaracuy, announced the measure as part of the town lockdown policy. \"We are protecting our people, [this sign] indicates a positive case or a potential case, so that people are aware,\" Duque says in the video, pointing to a red prohibition sign placed on the window of a local house.Read More People caught removing the Covid-19 signs on their homes would be fined 10 million bolivars, a sum out of reach for many in Venezuela, where the minimum monthly salary is less than a US dollar. Those who were not able to pay the fine would be required to serve days of \"voluntary\" community services, Duque said. A photo posted by mayor's office in the neighboring city of San Felipe also showed local officers standing next to a similar \"quarantine\" sign. The photo, which touted Mayor Rogger Daza's campaign against the coronavirus, has since been removed from social media. Some users on social media commended Mayor Duque for taking a strong stance against the pandemic, which has piled stress on a health sector already damaged by seven years of economic crisis.Latin America&#39;s grueling battle with Covid-19 isn&#39;t letting up According to figures collected by the Venezuelan government, the country has reported a total of 169, 074 cases and 1,693 deaths. However, health officials and the Venezuelan opposition have questioned the government's capacity to collect and analyze data, and warned the real number of cases could be much higher.  But criticism of the strategy was also fierce. Local Venezuelan NGO \"Access to Justice\" condemned the signs as harmful to the dignity of the patients, and a civil rights group in Yaracuy has called for a virtual protest on social media, since public gatherings are banned in Venezuela under lockdown rules. Miguelangel Delgado, 33, of San Felipe, deplored the signs as a way of instilling fear. \"People are afraid, there's a lot of rejection towards this way of dealing with the pandemic, but there's also a lot of fear to be singled out.\" Henry Narvae, 23, a local resident, told CNN the practice that such extreme containment measures were distraction from an actual lack of health services. \"The only solution the authorities put in place is to limit the citizens without providing any assistance,\" he said. \"Here in Guama, the Mayor has taken to mark houses and terrify the population with the military, which reminds me of the Nazis, while the town only has one ambulance to move patients,\" he added. Neither Duque nor Daza responded to CNN's attempts to contact both mayors by phone and messages. A spokesperson from Yaracuy's governor Julio Leon, who's currently in quarantine with coronavirus, told CNN the governor's office was aware of the signs displayed in Guama, but did not elaborate if Duque faced any censure from local authorities. They also said they would get back in touch with a response, but that hasn't happened so far.Bolsonaro shrugs off criticism he is &#39;genocidal&#39; as Brazil reports record 4,000 daily deaths Late on Wednesday night, the Venezuelan attorney general Tarek William Saab announced an investigation into Duque's actions, calling them \"macabre\" and not sanctioned by the Venezuelan government. Saab confirmed to CNN Duque was under investigation but said he could not comment on the ongoing case. The attorney general took several hours to intervene in the situation, and when he did so, social media was in flames around the issue. The two mayors are not alone in ordering drastic measures in an attempt to contain the virus. Embattled President Nicolas Maduro himself has taken the extreme step of ordering that all potential Covid-19 cases be hospitalized either in local hospitals or quarantined in ad-hoc facilities at hotels and recreation centers. On Thursday morning, however, at least one of the Covid-19 signs displayed in Guama had been removed Narvae told CNN, describing it as a small sign of defiance. \"The mayor wants to give the impression of control, but people are not okay with it,\" he said.\n",

      "Seoul (CNN)A South Korean tanker seized by Iranian authorities in January has been released. In a press release Friday, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the Hankuk Chemi and its captain were freed early Friday Iranian time. The captain and crew's health was sound -- as was the cargo, the ministry said. Iran seized the tanker at sea in January, accusing it of polluting the waters with chemicals and holding the vessel in the port of Bandar Abbas.Its release comes after South Korea promised to try to secure the release of Iranian funds frozen in South Korean banks under US sanctions, a South Korean official told Reuters.The Iranian Foreign Ministry confirmed the ship's release following the conclusion of an investigation and at the request of its owner and the South Korean government, according to state news agency IRNA.Read More\"Iran, with long coastlines in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, stresses full compliance with maritime regulations, including environmental protection, and monitors every violation in this respect,\" Saeed Khatibzadeh, a foreign ministry spokesman, was quoted as saying.He said the the Iranian decision to release the captain had taken into account that he had no record of past violations in the region.The issue triggered a diplomatic dispute after Iran demanded that South Korea release $7 billion in funds frozen in South Korean banks under US sanctions.A South Korean Foreign Ministry official told reporters Friday that both sides had agreed the ship and the funds were not related issues and South Korea promised to help get the money released.\"We have expressed our firm willingness to resolve the fund issue,\" said the official, who declined to be identified.The South Korean ministry said in a statement the ship had left Iran after completing administrative procedures. It made no mention of the demand for the release of funds.\"The captain and sailors are in good health,\" the ministry said.South Korea said the vessel did not cause any pollution. The ministry official said Iran dropped a plan to pursue seek criminal charges against the shipping company.Iran has denied allegations that the seizure of the tanker and its crew constituted hostage-taking, saying it was South Korea that was holding Iranian funds hostage.The freezing of the funds is linked to US sanctions that Washington reimposed on Tehran in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.Under the Biden administration, the United States and Iran have begun indirect talks over a return to the accord.The United States has recently agreed to allow Iran to use the funds for non-military purposes and it has spent some on coronavirus vaccines secured via the global COVAX initiative, the ministry official said, without giving a precise amount.\n",

      "(CNN)A shocked South Carolina community was grieving and looking for answers Thursday after officials said a beloved doctor and four other people were shot and killed by a man who had gone from a local high school on to college and the NFL. York County Sheriff Kevin Tolson said that on Wednesday afternoon Phillip Adams, 32, shot two air conditioning technicians outside -- killing one -- then forced his way into Dr. Robert Lesslie's home in Rock Hill.Lesslie, his wife, Barbara Lesslie, and two grandchildren, ages 5 and 9, were found shot to death in a back room.What we know about the mass shooting in York County, South CarolinaAir conditioning technician James Lewis, of Gastonia, North Carolina, was found dead outside. The surviving technician, Robert Shook, is out of surgery, according to a Facebook post from his daughter on Thursday evening. Her father is in intensive care on a ventilator, she wrote.Read MoreShe said that she was able to see him and that he has a \"very long road ahead of him.\" Adams was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the bedroom of a home about a half mile away that he shared with his parents.Tolson said it was unclear why Adams took two guns to the Lesslie property in Rock Hill, a city of 74,000 residents just across the border from Charlotte, North Carolina.\"There's nothing about this right now that makes sense to any of us,\" the sheriff said.A statement from the doctor's four children said the family is dealing with unimaginable loss.\"While we know there are no answers that will satisfy the question 'why,' we are sure of one thing: we do not grieve as those without hope. Our hope is found in the promise of Jesus Christ, and we are enveloped by peace that surpasses all understanding,\" the statement says.Lesslie was a \"pillar in the community,\" Tolson said of the doctor, who served as Winthrop University's supervising physician and medical director, and founded a hospice service and a house-call doctors' service.\"He treated me in the past at his clinic. ... he knew everyone, he treated everyone with respect,\" Tolson recalled.Winthrop University President George Hynd said Lesslie's contributions to the school were wide-ranging.\"Students, in particular, have long benefitted from referrals to his practice when additional care was needed beyond our scope,\" Hynd said in a statement. \"I personally will be forever grateful to him for the advice and counsel he provided to our COVID-19 response team as we opened the campus last fall to residential living and learning.\"Many questions, few answersInvestigators do not yet know what led to the shootings, though they believe Adams was the only assailant, Tolson said.\"We probably have more questions than you do about this case,\" the sheriff told reporters Thursday.Something that Adams left at the home led investigators to believe he was the gunman, and they went to the nearby Adams family home, Tolson said.Officers removed the parents from the home, and tried to contact Adams. They eventually found him deceased, Tolson said, though they did not hear gunshots.Adams died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, York County Coroner Sabrina Gast said.Dr. Robert Lesslie is seen in Rock Hill in March 2009.When asked whether Adams, who played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015, was a patient of the doctor, Tolson said: \"We have not been able to verify that.\"Adams played for several NFL teamsA South Carolina state official confirmed to CNN Thursday that Adams played in the NFL. Phillip Adams, seen as a San Francisco 49ers player in 2010.Adams played as a defensive back from 2010 to 2015 for teams including the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons. He had five interceptions and 121 tackles in 78 games, according to NFL.com. He also returned 37 punts while with the Raiders and 49ers.Adams' father, Alonzo Adams, told Charlotte TV station WCNC on Thursday morning that Lesslie used to be his doctor years ago. He said his son was a quiet, good kid -- but he thought football had taken its toll.Phillip Adams played at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg before his NFL days. He went to Rock Hill High School in his hometown, according to a SCSU athletics media guide. The shootingAuthorities were called around 4:45 p.m. to the Lesslies' home just south of Rock Hill, Tolson said. Tolson played two 911 calls for reporters at a news conference Thursday. In one, the air conditioning technicians' employer tells a 911 operator that a wounded worker had just called him about the shooting.\"(The worker was) screaming that he had been shot, and the other technician ... had been shot and was non-responsive,\" the caller tells the 911 operator.In the other call, a man tells an operator he was mowing grass when he heard popping noises. He says he went over to the Lesslie's property and from a distance saw one man lying on the ground and that's when he realized he had heard gunfire.The caller says he saw a man in black clothes walk out of the house.While the witness said he might have heard about 20 shots, the sheriff only confirmed there were \"multiple shots.\"Doctor had been practicing in area since 1981Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted his condolences to the victims.\"Tragic and heartbreaking news from Rock Hill this morning. Please join @1stLadySC and I in lifting up the Lesslie family in prayer during this difficult time,\" the tweet read.Trent Faris, the York County Sheriff's Office's spokesperson, said Thursday he knew Lesslie, and that \"Dr. Lesslie was my doctor growing up.\"\"Dr. Lesslie has been one of those people that everybody knows. He started Riverview Medical Center in Rock Hill and it has been a staple in Rock Hill for years,\" Faris said.\"If you are from Rock Hill and you are from around this area, the people who are involved are very prominent and very well known in York County,\" Faris said.Lesslie was the founder of Riverview House Calls and Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care, according to the services' joint website, and had been practicing in Rock Hill since 1981. In a personal bio page, Lesslie says he and his wife had been married for 40 years, raised four children and had nine grandchildren.\"In my spare time, I enjoy ​writing, golf, hunting, growing fruit and hops, and bagpiping,\" the bio page says. His website lists several books he authored, including 2008's \"Angels in the ER,\" a book about faith in God and the work of nurses, doctors and others during trying circumstances during his years working in an emergency room.\"I've been an observer of human condition as well as a physician. There's no better place to be an observer than the ER,\" he told The Herald of Rock Hill about the book in 2008. \"You find out what people are about. Everybody has something to teach us. I wanted to do this from a spiritual perspective. Once that became clear to me, it wrote itself.\"\n",

Multiple arrivals and departures this month make the floating laboratory seem more like a hotel.Russian space agency Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei successfully launched to the space station from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Friday. The launch was aired live on NASA's TV channel and website, with liftoff right on schedule at 3:42 a.m. ET. The first, second and third stage separations were smooth, leaving the spacecraft flying free with its deployed solar array and antennae.Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy holds up a toy cat that will be used in the Soyuz capsule to help indicate the start of weightlessness. Toys are often used as \"zero-G indicators\" during launches.The new crew docked to the station at 7:05 a.m. ET, and the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station will open around 9 a.m. ET. The docking and arrival will also air live.This speedy trip to the space station, which includes two orbits of Earth and about three hours of travel time, is courtesy of the new Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft.Read MoreTheir arrival will bring the total number of crew members on the station to 10 residents. Astronauts on the space station have prepared for the new crew by setting up extra sleep stations and freeing up ports. Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, along with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, recently relocated the Soyuz MS-17 capsule from its port to make room for the latest crew launching from Baikonur. The Soyuz spacecraft can be seen during flight in the middle of this image.Ryzhikov, Kud-Sverchkov and Rubins arrived on the space station in the Soyuz capsule after launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in October. The crew members moved their spacecraft from the Rassvet module, which has an Earth-facing port, and relocated it to the Poisk docking port, which faces space, in March. This freed up the Rassvet module port for the new crew and their Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft.Rubins, Ryzhikov and Kud-Sverchkov will return to Earth in the Soyuz MS-17 spacecraft on April 17.NASA astronauts conduct fifth spacewalk of 2021Members of the historic NASA-SpaceX Crew-1, including NASA astronauts Victor Glover Jr., Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi, who launched from the US to the space station in November, will also return after the launch of Crew-2 next month.This second rotation using the NASA-SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft will include NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas  Pesquet. Crew-2, which could launch April 22, will join Crew-1 on the space station before Crew-1 returns to Earth.This is the second spaceflight for Vande Hei, the third spaceflight Novitskiy and the first for Dubrov. Vande Hei was selected as an astronaut in 2009 and had his first spaceflight experience on the space station from September 2017 to February 2018. During his 168 days aboard the station, Vande Hei conducted four spacewalks. This time around, Vande Hei and the crew will work on multiple experiments, including studies about Alzheimer's disease and portable ultrasound devices.The Apollo 11 astronauts quarantined after returning to Earth. Here&#39;s whyVande Hei's flight on the Soyuz spacecraft is part of a contract with Axiom Space of Houston. In return, NASA will essentially save a seat on a future commercial spacecraft launch in 2023 for a non-NASA space station crew member.While NASA works with Boeing and SpaceX to ensure safe crew transport to and from the space station using US-based launches, grabbing one seat on the Soyuz means that there will always be at least one US crew member on the space station. Their launch occurs just three days before the 60th anniversary of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's launch as the first human in space, as well as the 40th anniversary of the first launch of NASA's space shuttle.Subscribe to CNN's Wonder Theory newsletter: Sign up and explore the universe with weekly news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n",

      "(CNN)After the worst wildfire season ever in 2020, California is bracing for more destruction this year due to worsening drought conditions and above-normal temperatures. \"We had world record-breaking high temperatures in our own backyard in California... 130 degrees in our state,\" Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday as he launched a $536 million funding package to boost fire prevention projects.The outlook is already ominous as 91% of the state is suffering from drought and has reported consecutive dry months since last October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  \"Even record investments in this space are not enough to deal with the magnitude of that reality,\" Newsom said. \"But yes, we need to do more on forest management and vegetation management.\"The new legislation will invest millions of dollars toward hiring additional fire personnel, buying mechanical equipment, building defensible spaces and developing vegetation-management projects that will control and slow down the fires, Newsom said.Read More\"We can't sugarcoat the fact that this summer is going to be challenging,\" said Wade Crowfoot, California's Natural Resources Secretary. \"We are just getting out of our second consecutive dry winter and what we can expect this summer in wildfire conditions is more of the same from last summer.\" Last year, California's wildfires consumed more than 4.2 million acres. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CAL FIRE, the fire season across the West has been starting earlier and ending later each year. The length of the fire season is estimated to have increased by 75 days across the Sierras and seems to correspond with an increase in the extent of forest fires across the state.Overall, California is budgeting more than $1 billion toward wildfire prevention and preparedness efforts, Newsom said. Last week, state officials approved the allocation of more than $80 million in emergency funds to elevate forest management and wildfire response efforts. This funding will specifically promote 1,399 additional firefighters within CAL FIRE and will allow training of fire crews ahead of peak fire season, which occurs between July through October.CAL FIRE says climate change is to blame for the increase in the wildfire season. \"Warmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire,\" it says on its website. California state officials are expected to review and approve details of the legislation early next week. \"Thank you to the California legislature for drawing these dollars down and getting us to a point where we can get these dollars to work at a record pace this state has not seen in the past,\" Newsom added.\n",

      "(CNN)A gunman killed one person and wounded at least five others -- four of them critically -- at a cabinet manufacturer in Bryan, Texas, on Thursday afternoon, police said.The gunman, who is believed to be an employee of the company, Kent Moore Cabinets, fled before police arrived but was later taken into custody, Bryan Police said.In a subsequent statement shared by CNN affiliate KBTX, the Bryan Police Department said the suspect was Larry Bollin of Grimes County, Texas. According to the release, the 27-year-old was taken into custody by the Texas Department of Public Safety and had been charged with murder. He was booked into the Brazos County Sheriff's Office, it said.Bryan Police Chief Eric Buske said earlier that it was not known how long the suspect had been working at the company, located inside an industrial park, or what the motive was for the shooting. Read MoreThe gunman used a handgun and acted alone, Buske said.Bryan police received a call around 2:30 p.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) of an active shooter at the facility, and several agencies arrived six minutes later, Buske said. They put out a broadcast on the suspect's vehicle, and troopers with the Department of Public Safety pursued it.Inside the business, police found at least one person dead and five people shot and wounded. Four of them were taken to the hospital in critical condition and the fifth was in \"noncritical\" condition, Buske said.A sixth person was taken to the hospital because of an asthma attack, he said.Buske had previously said four people were shot but later updated his statement.A trooper with the Texas Department of Public Safety was shot while pursuing the suspect, the department tweeted. The trooper is in stable condition at a local hospital, DPS Lt. Craig Cummings said at a news conference Thursday night.Employees on the shootingAmelia Rodriguez, a Kent Moore Cabinets employee, was painting with a coworker when she heard multiple booms, she told CNN affiliate KBTX.She said she thought, \"Oh, the machine got messed up again,\" and began walking toward it to fix it.\"I started walking and someone grabbed me and said, \"No, we need to run.'\"Rodriguez said she and her coworkers ran outside but then realized the gunman was outside, so a few of them ran back in, while others stayed by the fence.\"I was hiding like 10 minutes in a real small place,\" she said.She feels lucky to be alive, Rodriguez said.\"I think I'm very lucky and blessed to be talking to you this very moment,\" Rodriguez told the reporter. \"I'm still in shock because we live in a very peaceful community.\"Law enforcement responds to a reported shooting at a business in Bryan, Texas, on Thursday, April 8.The company said in a statement to KBTX that it was \"devastated\" by the shooting.\"We want to thank the many members of our law enforcement teams and other emergency personnel who responded so quickly,\" the statement read. \"We are fully cooperating with law enforcement during the investigation of this horrible crime.\"Following the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement the \"state will assist in any way needed to help prosecute the suspect.\"\"Cecilia and I are praying for the victims and their families and for the law enforcement officer injured while apprehending the suspect,\" Abbott said.This story has been updated with new information from Bryan police on casualties.\n",

The island is on red alert, meaning an eruption is \"imminent now,\" NEMO said. Evacuation orders are in place in about a dozen districts of St. Vincent, affecting roughly 6,000 to 7,000 people, a spokesperson for the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre, or UWI-SRC, told CNN.St. Vincent is the largest island of the St. Vincent and the Grenadines chain in the Caribbean.Scientists at the Belmont Observatory in St. Vincent observed a volcanic tremor on the island at about 3 a.m. local time, according to UWI-SRC. Read MoreThe first band of tremors was followed by five more throughout the day. This type of seismic signal is usually associated with movement of magma and fluids close to the surface, according to UWI-SRC. \"Ash venting was also observed during the most recent tremor episode,\" the center reported on Facebook. The volcano has had five explosive eruptions -- in 1718, 1812, 1814, 1902/03 and 1979 -- according to the seismic research center.Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley has spoken to Gonsalves and offered assistance, according to the Ministry of National Security for Trinidad and Tobago. Venezuela will send humanitarian supplies and risk experts, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on his Twitter account. Cruise lines to helpCruise ships are heading to the islands to assist in evacuations, NEMO officials wrote on their Twitter account. Carnival Cruise Lines is sending two ships -- the Carnival Paradise and the Carnival Legend -- to evacuate residents, a spokesperson told CNN.\"Each ship will accommodate up to 1,500 residents who will be transported to neighboring islands which have agreed to offer refuge out of harm's way.  All precautions will be taken to protect the health and safety of Carnival crew and the passengers who board the ships,\" the spokesperson said. The ships will arrive Friday, the spokesperson said.Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises are each sending one ship and should arrive Thursday night, according to a statement from Statement from Royal Caribbean International.\n",

      "(CNN)A Black man says officers with the Los Angeles Police Department violated his civil rights by racially profiling and wrongfully arresting him in a May 2019 incident during which he was mistaken for a man violating a restraining order, according to court documents obtained by CNN.\"Is this the dude?\" says an LAPD officer on newly released bodycam video from the incident. \"Probably,\" said the other officer as they drove up to Antone Austin, 42, who was outside of his Hollywood home around 3 p.m. to pick up garbage cans. Police were responding to a call from a woman regarding her ex-boyfriend and a restraining order violation. She had given no description of the suspect, which did not deter officers from pursuing Austin, according to the complaint filed in federal court last year.A judge unsealed the video from the officer's body-worn camera last week. The two clips, each a little over two minutes, obtained by CNN from a representative for Austin, show the quick escalation.CNN has requested comment from LAPD and the police union. The City Attorney's office said it did not have a comment.Read MoreBodycam video shows the confrontation\"What are you doing, bro, I live here,\" Austin, a music producer, says in the video as the officer approached. Austin turned around and put his hands on his head and asked the officers who they were looking for while he was frisked. An officer said police received a call, but \"I don't know who I'm looking for yet.\"Other officers are on scene and as Austin mildly protested an officer placed him in handcuffs. The officers pushed Austin against a wall as he struggled to elicit an answer from them and began yelling for his girlfriend. With his hands cuffed behind him, he repeatedly yelled, \"Help!\" as he and the officers tussled.Austin's girlfriend Michelle Michlewicz, 30, clad only in a bathrobe which sometimes flung open during the chaos, tried to understand what was going on. \"Why are you doing this?\" she asked repeatedly as Austin was heard telling officers they had the wrong person. \"This is dumb bro, stop, stop,\" he said as they struggled. \"I'm not him, bro, I'm not him,\" Austin repeated.As police attempted to handcuff Austin, Katarina Richardson, the neighbor who called police reporting her ex-boyfriend for the restraining order violation, told police that Austin was not the perpetrator, according to the complaint. During Richardson's call to police, she was not asked to provide a specific description.Bodycam footage released shows the 2019 arrest\"I was the first Black dude he saw and it's weird, they weren't even looking for a guy that looks like me, they were looking for a short dude that's bald, you know, but they didn't know that,\" said Austin to CNN affiliate KABC on Wednesday. Richardson's ex-boyfriend is White and \"much shorter than Antone,\" Jasmyne Cannick, a media representative for the couple, told CNN.When Michlewicz tried to prevent an officer from placing Austin in a chokehold, she was pushed into the street and disrobed, causing her severe emotional distress, according to the complaint. Both were taken to the police station and released on bail around 3 a.m. the next day, said the complaint.\"He was in fear for his life, he did not know what was gonna happen. He did not know -- is he going to be the next, you know, the next hashtag? The next guy that's gonna be killed?\" their lawyer, Faisal Gill, told KABC.Austin was initially charged with resisting arrest and battery on a peace officer. That was eventually dropped to resisting arrest with a $7,000 bond, Cannick said. Michlewicz, a singer, was charged with felony lynching with a bond of $50,000. The couple have not been formally charged or had their charges dismissed. They also have not had their bond money returned, according to Cannick.The couple is suing for unlawful seizure, battery, excessive force, failure to intervene, negligence, and civil rights violations. They are requesting $2 million. A jury trial is slated for October.\n",

Denise Moroney. Williams then went outside the salon and allegedly started yelling and threatening violence against an Asian woman, police said. CNN reached out to the salon for a comment on the incident. NYPD makes an arrest in the hate crime assault on a 65-year-old Asian womanA complaint filed by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office clarified that the woman who was harassed outside was an undercover officer and ended up arresting Williams. The arrest was the first since the department began an initiative at the end of March deploying undercover officers to combat the increase of anti-Asian violence, the NYPD said in a tweet. Read More\"Undercover Asian officers are working in areas that have had hate crimes to address the issue,\" the NYPD tweeted Wednesday. \"Yesterday, one of those officers was able to step in &amp; make an arrest during an anti-Asian incident in the @NYPD5Pct, marking the first arrest by this new initiative.\"The NYPD said she was arrested for harassment related to a hate crime, aggravated harassment based on race/religion and criminal trespass. The district attorney's office ended up charging Williams with one count of second-degree aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor. The charge is used when the defendant has \"intent to harass, annoy or threaten\" another person based on \"a belief and perception regarding such person's race, color, national origin\" or other identity markers, according to the statutory language.

      "(CNN)Amid the azaleas and magnolias of Augusta National, it was a Rose who flourished during the first round of golf's Masters.Justin Rose raced into a four-shot lead on Thursday thanks to a superb back nine that saw him finish on seven-under par.  Despite being two-over after seven holes, the Englishman rallied and hit an eagle on the eighth and seven birdies between the ninth and 17th to close four shots ahead of second-placed Brian Harman and Hideki Matsuyama. The first round also saw a number of pre-tournament contenders struggle. Defending champion Dustin Johnson carded a two-over 74, while last year's US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau finished on four-over. DeChambeau is tied with Rory McIlroy, whose task of completing a career grand slam with a Masters victory got off to a rocky start. Read More\"I knew two-over through seven is not the end of the world, but also knew you're going in the wrong direction,\" Rose, twice a runner-up at the Masters, told reporters of his slow start. \"You can't win the golf tournament today. Even with a 65, you can't win it today. You can only probably lose it today.\"I didn't hit the panic button yet (after seven), but I reset just prior to that and thought if I can get myself back around even par, that would be a good day's work.\"Justin Rose shot a stunning 65 in the opening round of the Masters. It's the fourth time that Rose has led or co-led the Masters after the first round, a record he now shares with Jack Nicklaus.The 40-year-old, playing his first tournament since withdrawing from the Arnold Palmer Invitational last month with a back injury, was one of only three players to finish under 70 alongside Harman and Matsuyama -- quite the contrast to last year's tournament when 24 players shot sub-70 scores in favorable November conditions.Tommy Fleetwood hits memorable hole-in-one at MastersRose's only previous major triumph came at the 2013 US Open; the closest he has come to securing a Green Jacket at the Masters was in 2017 when he was beaten in a playoff by Sergio Garcia.\"I've played this course many, many times, it's my 15th Masters, maybe, and my best to date is 67,\" Rose said.  \"I felt like the conditions today were not the day to go hit them and have your personal best out there.  \"It was pretty windy -- windy enough to be tricky -- and obviously the greens are incredibly firm and fast. The pin placements were fair, certainly not easy, but fair, and if you did hit the right shot at the right time, you could take advantage.\"  As for those further down the leaderboard, DeChambeau came into the Masters armed with a new driver and plenty expectations, but the big-hitter landed a number of tee shots off the fairway in the first round. Bryson DeChambeau hunts for his ball at the fourth hole.His 76 included a double bogey at the fourth and bogeys on the fifth, eighth and 12th before his sole birdie on the 15th. DeChambeau was joined by McIlroy on four-over, the Northern Irishman having finished in the top 10 at August National on six previous occasions but never securing a Green Jacket.That Masters victory looks likely to elude him once more as he shot six bogeys between the fifth and 13th holes on Thursday. It also proved an eventful day as he struck his dad with an errant shot on the seventh.World No. 1 Johnson, who claimed his second major title with a record-breaking 20-under at last year's Masters, started his bid to become the fourth player to win consecutive Green Jackets with a 74.Well-positioned on one-under with three holes to play, Johnson bogeyed the 16th and double bogeyed the 18th after his putt lipped out of the hole. Another former champion, Jordan Spieth, who returned to the winner's circle last week with his first victory in close to four years, rallied on the back nine after a triple bogey on the ninth to finish on one-under. 2018 champion Patrick Reed ended the day tied for fourth on two-under, while Justin Thomas and Jon Rahm -- second and third in the world rankings -- finished on one-over and par respectively.\n",

      "London (CNN Business)Airlines have panned the UK government's plan to restart foreign travel, arguing that expensive mandatory coronavirus tests will make vacations and family visits unaffordable for everyone but the rich.Under the \"traffic signal\" framework unveiled by the government on Friday, even Brits who travel to \"green\" countries deemed to be low risk must take a coronavirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test when they return to the United Kingdom. Each test costs around £120 ($165), adding £480 ($660) to the travel bill for a family of four.Travel from the United Kingdom has been banned for months except for people with a \"reasonable excuse.\" But foreign trips could resume as soon as May 17 under the government's roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions introduced in January.\"The insistence on expensive and unnecessary PCR testing rather than rapid testing — even for low-risk countries — will pose an unsustainable burden on passengers, making travel unviable and unaffordable for many people,\" said Tim Alderslade, CEO of Airlines UK, which represents carriers including British Airways (ICAGY), EasyJet (ESYJY) and Virgin Atlantic.\"It is also a further setback for an industry on its knees,\" he added.Read MoreEasyJet (ESYJY), the biggest UK airline, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reconsider the plan, which also requires people to quarantine at home for 10 days upon return from an \"amber\" country, or spend 10 days in a hotel if they've been to a \"red\" destination. Travelers to destinations that fall into either category will need to take two PCR tests following their return to the United Kingdom.Goodbye empty middle seats. Delta is selling the whole plane starting May 1\"This risks reversing the clock and making flying only for the wealthy,\" EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said in a statement. \"It is hugely frustrating that the taskforce has not delivered what the Prime Minister said they should achieve in making this flexible and affordable.\"Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss said that travel to and from \"green\" countries should be unrestricted without testing. The testing and quarantine requirements could deter many Brits from traveling abroad, meaning a second consecutive summer without the quick and easy budget getaways to countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece that have largely replaced domestic holidays in recent decades.The UK government won't confirm the restart date for foreign travel, or announce which countries fall into which risk category, until early May. Travel companies said the timetable doesn't provide enough clarity for their businesses or consumers. Jet2, which sells packaged holidays and operates tours, said Friday it would extend its suspension of flights until June 23 because of continued uncertainty.Disney sets opening date for Marvel&#39;s Avengers Campus\"We still do not know when we can start to fly, where we can fly to and the availability and cost of testing.

      "(CNN)A report that the Paris elite, including possibly even government ministers, have been savoring champagne and nibbling on foie gras and langoustines at clandestine upscale brasseries sparked outrage in the world's culinary capital. French TV channel M6 aired an undercover video showing a waiter informing a guest that there was no need to worry about Covid-19 inside a shuttered dining club, where other lucky patrons were shown exchanging cheek kisses.Restaurants have been shuttered since last year and France has plunged into another lockdown amid a fresh Covid surge, leaving gastronomes slumming it at home. The thought that those with means can buck the system is too much to bear. But if government ministers are involved, it will be a true scandal.It also wouldn't be the first time that those in power who lay down the lockdown law have effectively said do as I say, not as I do.In the United States, the Democratic mayor of Austin, Texas, Steve Adler, flew to a Mexican beach resort after telling residents to stay home. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz lambasted Adler, but that didn't stop him later flitting off to Mexico himself — while his constituents were in the dark after power outages caused by a freak snowstorm. California Governor Gavin Newsom often slapped restrictions on a state ravaged by the pandemic. But he was caught in a posh restaurant chowing down with lobbyists in November. Of course, the king of all rule breakers was Donald Trump — who disastrously undermined his own government's response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years by mocking masks and holding super spreader rallies.But perhaps the most celebrated show of hypocrisy was when Dominic Cummings —  an ex-adviser to British PM Boris Johnson — drove more than 250 miles with his family to the northern town of Barnard Castle, as the Downing Street operation he ran with an iron fist told Britons to stay indoors.Read MoreIt doesn't take much to get the French on the streets. So if new details blow the lid off the scandal we might see the hoi polloi gathering outside the underground restaurants demanding their own helpings of lobster and foie gras. To which the retort might come from within: Let them eat cake.'Before the summer is over'It's the first rough timeline for the US to start sharing excess vaccine doses with other countries. On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said he is eyeing the end of summer as a time when the US can begin shipping some of its surplus: \"My hope is before the summer is over, I'm talking to you all about how we have even access to more vaccines than we need to take care of every American, and we're helping other poor countries, countries around the world that don't have the money, the time, the expertise,\" Biden said at the White House. \"Until this vaccine is available to the world and we're beating back the virus in other countries we're not really completely safe.\"Just businessThe Republican Party and corporate America were once indistinguishable. GOP lawmakers would lower taxes and cut regulations, and big business would fund their campaigns and supply cushy retirement jobs on the board. But the fraught politics left in Trump's wake are causing an ugly fracture.Republicans are furious that Georgia-based giants like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines caved to activist pressure and condemned a new state elections law that makes it harder for Black people to vote. Sport was once a neutral zone where conservatives and liberals could escape politics. But when Major League Baseball, which has more right-leaning fans than the NBA, for instance, pulled its annual All-Star Game from Atlanta, a furious new front opened in America's endless culture war.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a dry sort not known for tantrums, fired off an extraordinary tirade. \"From election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment, parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government,\" said the Kentucky Republican, a longtime defender of big companies using their corporate cash reserves to shape US elections. \"Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.\"Big business isn't sentimental. Executives could yet reconcile with the GOP over shared resistance to Biden's plans to raise the corporate tax rate in order to pay for his infrastructure package. And there's no way they'll pull their millions of dollars in campaign cash if Republicans look likely to win back control of Congress and the White House.But they also appear to be making a judgment about who their customers will be in coming decades. While they might incur conservative boycotts in the short term, they fear alienating a rising tide of young, ethnically diverse and more socially liberal consumers now coming of age. In fact, they are acting on exactly the same assessment of the political map as the GOP legislators who are changing voting rules to hold at bay a growing anti-conservative wave.\n",

      "(CNN)As the US aims to ramp up inoculations to win the race against Covid-19 variants, more than 1 in 4 adults are now fully vaccinated.While more than 66 million people have received two doses, more than a third of  Americans -- or 112 million -- have received at least one dose, according to data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Officials and experts hope to get Americans vaccinated quickly as lockdown fatigue takes its toll and many people are letting down their guard just as more transmissible, and perhaps more deadly, variants of the virus become dominant. In that effort, all 50 states have committed to opening vaccinations to all Americans 16 and up by April 19.Fauci says new Covid-19 cases are at a disturbing level as the US is primed for a surge \"It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said earlier this week, noting Europe is experiencing a spike much like the one experts worry about for the US.The US added 79,878 new cases Thursday, the highest since March 24. And the country is still averaging above 60,000 new cases a day -- a level Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, said puts the US at risk for another surge. Experts are especially concerned about the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK and now the dominant strain in the US.Read More\"I wish we had another three or four months before this B.1.1.7 variant surge started to occur,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said this week.As states including California and Vermont plan to fully reopen this summer, experts are warning that to truly declare victory against the variants, Americans need to get vaccinated and continue measures like social distancing and mask wearing.Experts address vaccine reaction concernsThough some in the public have expressed concern over their possible adverse reactions to vaccines, health experts are advising that the benefits outweigh the risks.On Thursday, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said it determined that the adverse reaction suffered by 11 people who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the Dick's Sporting Goods Park vaccination site was \"no cause for concern.\"Biden moves deadline for all US adults to be eligible for Covid vaccine to April 19\"After reviewing each patient's symptoms, analyzing other vaccinations from the same lot of the vaccine and speaking with the CDC to confirm our findings, we are confident in saying that there is no reason for concern,\" Dr. Eric France, chief medical officer with CDPHE said. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health has begun a clinical trial to determine whether people who are highly allergic or have mast cell disorder are more likely to experience an immediate allergic reaction to the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines, according the agency's news release.Mast cell disorder is caused by an abnormal accumulation of a type of white blood cell that leads to allergic reactions. \"The public understandably has been concerned about reports of rare, severe allergic reactions to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines,\" Fauci said. \"The information gathered during this trial will help doctors advise people who are highly allergic or have a mast cell disorder about the risks and benefits of receiving these two vaccines. However, for most people, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweigh the risks.\"Universities aim to protect against outbreaksRecent cases of Covid-19 are skewing younger, in part because of activities like school sports and because of more older people being vaccinated, Fauci said Wednesday. Now, some universities are implementing policies to avoid further outbreaks among their students.Five states account for 43% of the country&#39;s new Covid-19 cases in the past weekThe University of Chicago issued a stay-at-home order for students living in residence halls for the next seven days, a letter from the dean and vice president said Thursday.The order comes after more than 50 cases of Covid-19 were detected among students. It is the largest cluster of cases the school has experienced since the beginning of the academic year, according to the letter. \"Many of these cases may have been connected to one or more parties held by off-campus fraternities over the last week,\" the letter said. Meanwhile, the University of Notre Dame in Indiana as well as Syracuse University and Ithaca College in New York are joining the growing list of colleges and universities requiring the Covid-19 vaccine for students prior to returning to campuses in the fall.Another US Covid-19 surge may look different, experts say, particularly for younger people. Here&#39;s howSeveral other schools made similar announcements this week. CNN counts 14 college and universities nationwide that have announced they will require students to be fully vaccinated.\"After a long year, this should give all of us hope for a return to a normal campus experience,\" said Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud. \"At every turn, you have demonstrated what it means to be Orange by navigating these extraordinary times with grit, grace and determination. Now, I ask that each of you take the next step by being vaccinated.\"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated how many Americans have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It is a third of all Americans.\n",

      "(CNN)How's former President Donald Trump filling his days now that he's gone from the White House? Judging from his public statements, he's watching the battle for the Senate majority in 2022 closely -- and trying to handpick GOP candidates in several key races.On Thursday, apropos of nothing, Trump endorsed Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson (R) for reelection in 2022 -- even though the incumbent is undecided about whether to run again. (Johnson ruled out a run for governor in mid-March.)\n",

      "\"Even though he has not yet announced that he is running, and I certainly hope he does, I am giving my Complete and Total Endorsement to Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin,\" said Trump. \"He is brave, he is bold, he loves our Country, our Military, and our Vets.  He will protect our Second Amendment, and everything else we stand for. It is the kind of courage we need in the U.S. Senate. He has no idea how popular he is. Run, Ron, Run!\"Which, well, OK!It's no surprise that Trump likes Johnson. After all, the Wisconsin Republican has spread any number of falsehoods about the 2020 election -- even going so far as to demand that Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr provide evidence that the election wasn't stolen. Johnson has also suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (a California Democrat) impeached Trump over his actions on January 6 in order to cover up her culpability in the US Capitol riot. (Yes, really!)Read MoreThe pre-endorsement of Johnson was Trump's latest attempt to shape the 2022 Senate playing field. On Wednesday, Trump had waded into what is expected to be a crowded primary race to replace retiring Sen. Richard Shelby (R) by endorsing Rep. Mo Brooks.\"Few Republicans have as much COURAGE and FIGHT as Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks,\" said Trump. \"Mo Brooks has my Complete and Total Endorsement for the U.S. Senate representing the Great State of Alabama.  He will never let you down!\"Brooks was the first Republican member of Congress to announce he would object to the 2020 Electoral College results. He has also wrongly suggested that Antifa was behind the January 6 riot.Trump has also conducted a mini-episode of \"The Apprentice\" with the four main candidates running for the Ohio open-seat Senate race and made clear that he plans to actively work to defeat Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) next November. Trump also endorsed Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul for reelection on Thursday.The likely Pennsylvania US Senate candidacy of Sean Parnell, who ran unsuccessfully for the House in 2020 with Trump's strong endorsement, could also garner an endorsement from the former President in a key open-seat race.The Point: Even though we are only a few months into the 2022 election cycle, Trump has already made clear that he wants to -- and will -- play a central role in selecting Republican candidates. And that his choices will be based far less on which candidate has the best chance to win and more on who agrees with him most often.\n",

      "New York (CNN Business)Information scraped from around 500 million LinkedIn user profiles is part of a database posted for sale on a website popular with hackers, the company confirmed Thursday.The sale of the data was first reported on Tuesday by cybersecurity news and research site CyberNews, which said that an archive including user IDs, names, email addresses, phone numbers, genders, professional titles and links to other social media profiles was being auctioned off on the forum for a four-figure sum. According to LinkedIn, the database for sale \"is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies.\" The data from LinkedIn users includes only information that people listed publicly in their profiles, the professional social media site, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT), said in a Thursday statement.\"This is not a LinkedIn data breach, and no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in what we've been able to review,\" the company said. The news comes just days after a separate incident in which data scraped from more than 500 million Facebook users in 2019 — including phone numbers, birthdays, emails and other information — was posted publicly on a website used by hackers. While these kinds of data are less sensitive than, say, credit card details or social security numbers, information like phone numbers can still be exploited by bad actors, including for robocall scams. Read MoreLinkedIn has more than 675 million members, according to its website, meaning that around three quarters of its users' information may be included in the database.Social media companies have tools in place aimed at preventing scrapers — LinkedIn on its terms page details \"technical measures and defenses\" against such abuse — but they don't always work.The company said that \"any misuse of our members' data, such as scraping\" violates its terms of service, which prohibit third-party software, bots, browser extensions or plug-ins that scrape data from the site. \"When anyone tries to take member data and use it for purposes LinkedIn and our members haven't agreed to, we work to stop them and hold them accountable,\" LinkedIn said in its statement.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it will alert users whose data was scraped and is included in the database for sale.\n",

      "(CNN)Parents' attendance at sporting events is normally for supportive measures. And while he might've been looking to give moral support for his son Rory, Gerry McIlroy proved a physical obstruction instead. In the opening round of the Masters, Rory was in the trees to the left on hole No. 7 after his tee shot had skewed off line. And in his attempt to correct after his wayward drive, the Northern Irishman hit his second shot to the right of the green and into where the spectators were standing. Unfortunately for McIlroy, his ball hit the calf of his father -- who was facing in the opposite direction -- and rolled away from the green. Read MoreREAD: Moe Norman: The 'Rain Man of golf' who amazed even the greats of the sportMcIlroy reacts on the seventh green during the first round of the Masters.Startled, Gerry looked back at the ball before limping away. CBS Sports golf writer Kyle Porter, who was standing near the hole when McIlroy hit his father, reported that Gerry said as he limped away: \"I should ask for an autographed glove.\"However, Rory had a better idea. \"He's seen me sign plenty of stuff over the years, so I think that's the least of his worries,\" he told the media afterward. \"I think he just needs to go and put some ice on -- maybe I'll autograph a bag of frozen peas for him.\" McIlroy ended up bogeying the hole, his third bogey in a row. The 31-year-old, who is looking to win the Masters to complete his career grand slam, had his problems throughout the opening round. The old phrase says: \"You can't win a golf tournament on the first day, but you can lose it.\" And McIlroy's chances of winning might already be over. He finished the day four over with six bogeys in total.

      ">This feature is part of CNN Style's new series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.Here's a thought experiment: Close your eyes and imagine the font you'd use to depict the word \"Chinese.\" There's a good chance you pictured letters made from the swingy, wedge-shaped strokes you've seen on restaurant signs, menus, take-away boxes and kung-fu movie posters. These \"chop suey fonts,\" as American historian Paul Shaw calls them, have been a typographical shortcut for \"Asianness\" for decades. Shaw traces the fonts' origins to the Cleveland Type Foundry which obtained a patent for a calligraphy-style printing type, later named Mandarin, in 1883. It is perhaps no surprise that this Eastern-inspired lettering emerged in the late 19th century, an era when Orientalism coursed feverishly through the West.  \"Mandarin, originally known as Chinese, is the granddaddy of 'chop suey' types,\" Shaw wrote in the design magazine, Print. \"Neither the food nor the fonts bear any real relation to true Chinese cuisine or calligraphy. But this has not prevented the proliferation of chop suey lettering and its close identification with Chinese culture outside of China.\" House of Moy Lee Chin Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida in 1980. Credit: Library of CongressType designers in the West have since cooked up many of their own versions of chop suey. Variations on the font are commercially distributed as Wonton, Peking, Buddha, Ginko, Jing Jing, Kanban, Shanghai, China Doll, Fantan, Martial Arts, Rice Bowl, Sunamy, Karate, Chow Fun, Chu Ching San JNL, Ching Chang and Chang Chang. It's hard not to cringe at the Chinese stereotypes bundled up with each font package -- especially when seen through the lens of today's heightened vigilance toward discrimination and systemic racism. Critics believe that using chop suey typefaces is downright racist, particularly when deployed by non-Asian creators. White politicians, meanwhile, have been using chop suey fonts to stoke xenophobia for over a century. In her book, \"This is What Democracy Looked Like: A Visual History of the Printed Ballot,\" Cooper Union professor Alicia Cheng draws attention to the \"chopsticks font,\" as she calls it, used by San Francisco politician Dr. C. C. O'Donnell on a 1876 ballot, as he vowed to deport all Chinese immigrants if he was elected into office. Dr. C. C. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s ballot shows a candidate pushing a ball that reads &quot;Chinese Exclusion&quot; with a stick labeled &quot;perserverance&quot;. Credit: California Historical SocietyMore contemporary examples include Pete Hoekstra, the former US ambassador to the Netherlands, who -- during his run for Senate in 2012 -- was criticized for campaigning with an ad featuring a caricature of a Chinese woman and a website with chop suey lettering. And in 2018, The New Jersey Republican State Committee used a version of the all-too-familiar font in a mailer attacking Korean American Democrat Andy Kim. The incendiary headline read, \"There's something REAL FISHY about Andy Kim.\"Hoekstra's press team and the New Jersey Republican State Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Why some Asian Americans are embracing their heritage by dropping their anglicized namesCompanies and advertisers have also looked to exploit stereotypes associated with the typefaces. During World War II, oil giant Texaco produced a series of posters featuring chop suey fonts next to a buck-toothed caricature in order to vilify the \"Yellow Peril.\" When asked to comment on the historical posters, a spokesperson for Chevron Corporation, now Texaco's parent company, told CNN: \"Texaco's World War II posters are regrettable and inconsistent with Chevron's values.\" An anti-Japanese propaganda poster that circulated during the World War II. Credit: From TEXACOSimilarly, online grocer Fresh Direct, clothing brand Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and the game developers behind \"Cyberpunk 2077,\" CD Projekt, are among the many companies criticized for using culturally appropriative fonts in the last two decades.A spokesperson for FreshDirect told CNN that the company \"unequivocally\" denounces racism and discrimination and regrets using a controversial typeface on advertising and packaging for its \"stir fry kits,\" adding that no-one involved in the 2012 decision is still at the organization. A spokesperson for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, meanwhile, said in an email that T-shirts featuring caricatures and stereotypical fonts from 2002 \"were inexcusable 19 years ago when they were released, and they do not reflect A&amp;F Co.'s values today.\" The spokesperson added that the company encourages a \"culture of belonging\" and is \"committed to doing better in the future.\"CD Projekt, which used stereotypical Asian fonts in game graphics last year, did not respond to CNN's request for comment.In 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic ushering a new tide of Sinophobia, Canadian apparel brand Lululemon fired its art director after he seemingly endorsed a \"Bat Fried Rice\" T-shirt design bearing the words \"No Thank You,\" by posting it to his Instagram. The design featured a chop suey font on a take-out box with bat wings, alluding to the purported origins of the coronavirus. While the shirt wasn't his creation, the art director told various media outlets, \"It is something I deeply regret, and my eyes have been opened to the profound ripple effect that this mistake has had.\" Lululemon quickly distanced itself from its art director emphasizing that the brand had not produced the \"inappropriate and inexcusable\" shirt.Racist undertonesFor an older generation of Asian Americans, spotting the faux brushstroke lettering can trigger past traumas.\"I think of words in anti-Asian or anti-Japanese signs,\" wrote Japanese American journalist Gil Asakawa, who began his career during a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment or \"Nipponophobia\" in the 1980s. \"I see (the font) Wonton and I see the words 'Jap,' 'nip,' 'chink,' 'gook,' 'slope.' I can't help it. In my experience, the font has been associated too often with racism aimed at me.\" The &quot;Wonton&quot; font. But can a font, in itself, truly be racist? In 19th-century Germany, using a calligraphic blackletter typeface called Fraktur was considered as an expression of nationalism. German books were printed in this gothic-style font, despite being hard to read. The Nazi party then embraced Fraktur -- it was even used on the cover of Adolf Hitler's manifesto, \"Mein Kampf\" -- before suddenly banning the font in 1941 and categorizing it as Judenlettern (\"Jewish letters\").  Yet, there are also examples of fonts harmlessly evoking national or regional pride. Take the distinctive Euskara lettering, used throughout the seven provinces of the Basque County, and deployed on everything from monuments to restaurant menus. The \"large-footed, big-eyed, Roman-styled characters,\" as a 19th-century chronicler of the region's monuments once described them, emerged during the pinnacle of Basque nationalism in the late 1800s.It's worth noting that, in 1930s America, some Chinese immigrants themselves used chop suey fonts on their restaurant signs, menus, and advertisements, as a way to heighten the exotic appeal of their establishments.On deeply personal terms, Asian Americans are disrupting the beauty industryAnd \"Oriental simulation fonts\" (or letterforms designed with aesthetic markers of a particular culture) didn't just approximate Chinese calligraphy. Decorative fonts like El Dorado or Taco Salad were designed to represent Mexico. The same goes for the Pad Thai font, which borrows strokes from the Thai script. Similarly, there are a host of crude, hand-drawn fonts purporting to capture the aesthetic of the entire African continent. &quot;The Pad Thai&quot; typeface borrows strokes from the Thai script.  Shaw said that the persistence of ethnic types, as offensive as they appear to some, lies in their graphic efficiency. They survive \"for the simple reason that stereotypes, though crude, serve a commercial purpose,\" he wrote. \"They are shortcuts, visual mnemonic devices. There is no room for cultural nuance or academic accuracy in a shop's fascia.\" For Yong Chen, a historian at the University of California, Irvine, it is not the font, per se, that's the issue -- but how it's used. His 2014 book \"Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America,\" even features the typeface on its cover. \"The font issue never came up during discussions of the cover design,\" Yong said in an email. Problems only arise, he said, when the font is deliberately used to \"depict Chinese Americans and Chinese food as the Oriental other.\"Chris Wu, a scholar of Chinese typography and co-founder of the New York-based design studio Wkshps, echoed Young's tempered view. \"I am not offended by those typefaces, rather intrigued by them,\" he explained in an email. \"I am glad to see the discussions and criticism about the ethnic fonts today -- it reflects a much well-informed visual culture and the sensibilities to respect minorities. However, I'd be careful about over simplifying the stories and the sentiment of embracing authenticity.\"San Francisco police officers pass an art installation called &quot;Hopes for Chinatown.&quot; Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesBeyond chop sueyAs diverse and modern as Asia is, its prevailing typographic representations remain stuck in a bygone era. So, can we ever escape chop suey font? \"In light of the tensions in the US around race and racial stereotypes in 2020, (these fonts are) not the kind of thing I would want to be developing today,\" said Tom Rickner, creative director at Monotype, a 134-year old digital foundry with several chop suey fonts in its catalog.  Recalling the lone Chinese restaurant in the town he grew up in during the 1970s, Rickner explained that the foreigner-friendly chop suey fonts helped proprietors attract diners, much like the first wave of immigrant Chinese business owners in San Francisco in the 1930s. \"Back then, a menu item like Peking duck was considered avant-garde and completely new and different, but we've gone so far beyond that,\" he said, adding that we now have alternatives to worn-out typographic tropes. Tokio Restaurant or &quot;The Tokio,&quot; was founded by Charles Kline, Harry Salvin, and Henry Fink in 1910 near Broadway in New York City. Credit: From New York Public LibraryRickner, who was once Apple's lead typographer, points to the flourishing of non-English digital typefaces in recent years. For example, there's Caspar Lam and YuJune Park's elegant serif Ming Romantic, commissioned by Vogue China and Google's open source Korean fonts, created by a team of Korean type designers, including E Roon Kang, who spoke on the challenges of creating digital fonts in the language. Korean's Hangul writing system has a \"unique way of combining consonants and vowels for a single letter\" that results in a greater volume of letterforms, and therefore larger file sizes for browsers, Kang explained in an email. He said the 2018 project had made fonts -- which can be complicated and involve creating various subsets -- easier to access by designers and developers, while adding that part of its design includes an interactive function that emphasizes the letters' \"malleable nature\" to encourage more participation. Google&#x27;s open source project on Korean fonts invites users to play with stylized variations of fonts.  Credit: From Google Fonts + KoreanChinese characters in the Ming Romantic font.

Design schools, like KABK (The Royal Academy of Art) in The Hague, Netherlands, and the University of Reading's department of typography and graphic communication in the UK, are also training students to design fonts in the world's languages -- including Chinese, which is notoriously onerous to recreate digitally.\"We need to democratize the education of type design across different ethnic and economic, socioeconomic backgrounds,\" Rickner said. \"There's work to be done there, but it's happening. \"The right way forward is to have bilingual, trilingual, even multilingual typography,\" he added, suggesting that Chinese restaurant menus could perhaps, be presented in both English and (either simplified or traditional) Chinese characters. \"As a type designer, I want to celebrate those languages and those cultures. What we love is building new typefaces that support multiple scripts and languages, and today we're in such a better place than we were even just five years ago.\"This article has been update to include a response from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. It was also updated to reflect that Pete Hoekstra is the former US ambassador to the Netherlands.\n",

      "London (CNN)The most famous family on earth is mourning the loss of its patriarch.  Prince Philip, the husband of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced. He was 99.  The Duke of Edinburgh -- who married then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 -- was the longest-serving consort in British history.  He will be remembered for his charitable work, his dedication to public service and, of course, his mischievous and controversial sense of humor.  Phillip once jokingly referred to himself as \"the world's most experienced plaque unveiler.\" But as a child born into the turmoil of interwar Europe and a naval officer decorated for heroism during World War II, the Duke of Edinburgh was an extraordinary figure in his own right.  Read MoreChildhood and exile  Philip's life was dramatic from the outset. The nephew of Greece's King Constantine I, the Prince of Greece and Denmark was born in 1921 on the dining room table of a villa on the Greek island of Corfu.   He was forced into exile just 18 months later, when the Greek monarchy was overthrown by a military revolt. His family's experience shaped Philip's later desire to modernize the British Royalty, in the hope they would seem more relevant to the Queen's subjects.   Photos: Prince Philip&#39;s life in picturesBritain's Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, poses in his military dress uniform circa 1990.Hide Caption 1 of 49 Photos: Prince Philip&#39;s life in picturesPrince Philip was born into the royal families of Greece and Denmark.

This meant Philip rarely saw his parents growing up. He was instead mentored by an uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, and dispatched to a series of boarding schools in England, Germany and Scotland.  This photo from September 1928 was taken during a family vacation in Mamaia, Romania. It features, from left, Princess Fedora of Greece, King Michael and his mother Princess Helene, Princess Irene, Princess Marguerite, Prince Philip and Prince Paul.In 1935, Greece voted to reinstate its monarchy, but Philip's father Andrew resisted pressure to push his son into the Greek military service. Instead, Philip remained at Gordonstoun, the school in Scotland where he would later send his own sons, including Prince Charles. It was here he began preparing for training to join the British Royal Navy.  Tragedy struck in 1937, when Philip's sister, Cecile, died in an airplane crash while going into labor. Her husband and prematurely born child both lost their lives too.  The war years -- and a princess  He joined the Navy in 1939, the same year he met Elizabeth when she visited the Royal Navy College in Dartmouth with her father, King George VI. The trip had been arranged by Mountbatten.  One of his cousins, Lady Kennard, described the teenage Prince as \"like a sort of young Viking, very blond and strong and very handsome. Oh, I think he was everybody's heartthrob.\"  As a citizen of Greece, Philip was initially deployed as a \"neutral foreigner\" serving on naval escort and convoy missions. But after Italy invaded Greece in 1940, he was assigned to Valiant, a battleship that would soon see action in the Mediterranean.   Philip was commended for his operation of searchlights during night battle in 1941 near Cape Matapan, where the British destroyed much of the Italian fleet. He was later awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor.  After numerous postings and promotions, Philip was in 1944 appointed first lieutenant of HMS Whelp, a destroyer that would be deployed in the Pacific as part of a British fleet in joint operations with the US Navy, including the landings at Iwo Jima during the Pacific conflict. When peace came, Philip remained in the navy, but rekindled a friendship with Elizabeth that blossomed into a public romance.  Marriage into the British royal family  In 1947, Philip became a naturalized British subject, renounced his royal titles and changed his name from Philip Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg. He took the surname of his uncle and godfather, becoming Philip Mountbatten.  The couple married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Shortly afterward, Philip returned to naval duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.  Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip wave to the crowd from a balcony of Buckingham Palace shortly after their wedding at London's Westminster Abbey in 1947.Newly appointed as the Duke of Edinburgh, Philip had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the then King, George VI, fell ill. The King died on February 6, 1952, while Philip and Elizabeth were on an official trip to Kenya. It was Philip who broke the news to his wife -- now the Queen.  The royal couple had two children before Elizabeth acceded to the throne -- Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950 -- and two after, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. They have eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.  During the early years of the couple's marriage, the Prince enjoyed the height of his popularity. On their first major tour together -- to Canada and the US in 1951 -- huge crowds turned out to see the couple.  Their relationship was discussed in an ITV documentary about Prince Philip and the 60th anniversary of his charity, Duke of Edinburgh award, in 2016.  Sophie Wessex, wife of the couple's youngest son, Prince Edward, revealed how the pair still enjoyed each other's company after more than six decades of marriage.  \"He has been a fantastic life partner for her. I think it's maybe a fairly lonely job being Queen,\" she said. \"As a female in the top job, I think to have somebody you can lean on, you can discuss things with, she can be honest with behind closed doors ... I don't think she could have chosen better. And they make each other laugh, which is half the battle, isn't it?\"  Horses, polo and gaffes The Duke himself spoke of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family, saying he took on patronages out of duty rather than passion.  \"I didn't want to be president of the World Wildlife Fund,\" he said in an interview in 1992. \"I was asked to do it. I'd much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly.\"  But it is for his charitable work that many will remember him. As of 2016, more than 2.4 million people had achieved a Duke of Edinburgh Award in the United Kingdom alone. The program operates in more than 140 countries and territories in total.  The Queen&#39;s husband, Prince Philip, diesHe was also a patron or member of 785 national organizations, many of them charities.  As of May 2017, Buckingham Palace said Philip had carried out 22,191 solo engagements since becoming Prince Consort in 1952. He made 637 solo overseas visits, more than a third of them to Commonwealth countries. He also gave 5,493 speeches and authored 14 books.  Yet he found time to pursue his own interests: over the years these have included polo, barbecues, competitive horse carriage driving (a sport in which he has represented Britain) and practical jokes. He even trained to be a pilot, being awarded his \"wings\" in 1953. Philip's passion for flying led to speculation that he might fly the Queen to her Scotland residence, Balmoral, for a holiday before her coronation on June 2.  Philip had no constitutional roles other than being a privy counselor, but the Queen in 1952 declared that he had \"place, pre-eminence and precedence\" next to herself \"on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by act of Parliament.\"  Over the years Philip also cultivated a reputation for numerous gaffes and indiscreet comments, which helped shape some of his public persona.  In 1986, Philip made a number of remarks that offended many Chinese.  Notoriously, on an official visit to China, he told a group of British exchange students: \"If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.\" His verdict on the Chinese capital? \"Ghastly.\"  The same year, he told a World Wildlife Fund meeting that \"if it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has got two wings and flies but is not an aeroplane and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.\"  In 1998, he asked a British student who had been trekking in Papua New Guinea: \"You managed not to get eaten then?\"  Unseen footage of Queen Elizabeth revealedAnd four years later, while touring Australia with the Queen, he reportedly asked a group of Aborigines: \"Do you still throw spears at each other?\"  However, as Harry Mount, who had been on the receiving end of Philip's wit, wrote for CNN after the news that he'd be stepping down from public life, the \"gaffes\" were a way of making people feel at ease in the presence of royalty. \"The 'gaffes', I suddenly saw, were brilliant devices to make you feel at ease in his company. He was behaving like the sort of old friend who shows how much he likes you by teasing you.\"  His retirement had been a long time coming. During an interview with the BBC for his 90th birthday in 2011, Philip said it was time to take a step back from his responsibilities.  \"I reckon I've done my bit, I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say,\" he said.  However, Philip continued to appear by the Queen's side. In 2012, he was with Elizabeth as she undertook a busy schedule of public engagements across the UK to mark her 60 years on the throne. In a diamond jubilee address to Parliament in March 2012, the Queen said the support of her own family had been \"beyond measure\" throughout her reign. In a special tribute to her husband, she said: \"Prince Philip is, I believe, well known for declining compliments of any kind. But throughout he has been a constant strength and guide.\" Philip finally retired from public life in the fall of 2017 but continued to make some public appearances. He attended the wedding of his grandson Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018, followed by the wedding of granddaughter Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank in October that year. Philip also attended the small, private wedding of granddaughter Princess Beatrice to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July 2020. That same month, he took part in a ceremony to hand over his role as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles to the Duchess of Cornwall, in what was his last public appearance. The announcement in 2017 that he was stepping back from public life brought glowing tributes in the British press to Philip's long decades of service to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, both by the Queen's side and in more than 22,000 solo engagements.  Those who have known Philip away from the public eye, such as actress Dame Judi Dench, described him as \"an indomitable person.\"  Joanna Lumley, the British actress, who knew Philip for years, labeled him an \"extraordinary character.\"  \"He rides, sails, drives horses, fishes and swims and does stuff,\" Lumley told ITV. \"He really could have been James Bond, actually.\"\n",

      "Naypyidaw, Myanmar  (CNN)\"This is not a coup,\" said Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun from a gilded hall in Myanmar's purpose-built capital Naypyidaw, the city where his comrades recently ousted an elected government, detained the country's leadership, and installed a military junta.During an hour-long conversation with CNN, the military spokesperson was steadfast in upholding the junta's official narrative: that the generals are merely \"safeguarding\" the country while they investigate a \"fraudulent\" election. The bloodshed on the streets that has killed at least 600 people is the fault of \"riotous\" protesters, he said. At one point, Zaw Min Tun said if civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi's father -- the assassinated independence hero Aung San, who founded the country's modern military -- could see the situation now, he would say: \"You are such a fool, my daughter.\"The interview took place during a week-long press tour of Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, and Naypyidaw from March 31 to April 6. Prior to the trip, the military assured CNN it would be able to report independently and be given freedom of movement, but the journalists' request to stay in a Yangon hotel was denied and the team instead were housed in a walled military compound, given only intermittent and heavily controlled access to the public.Major General Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson for the Myanmar military, at the Defense Services Museum in Naypyidaw, Myanmar on April 4, 2021.The following interview with Zaw Min Tun offers an insight into how Myanmar's military junta are trying to justify their bloody takeover to the world, while at the same time cocooning themselves in government buildings far from a populace fiercely resistant to their rule, as they order deadly crackdowns on their own citizens in villages, towns and cities across the country. Read MoreCNN was provided with military interpreters, but conducted its own translations afterward.The back storyHours after commander-in-chief of Myanmar's armed forces Gen. Min Aung Hlaing ordered his troops to seize the capital before dawn on February 1, he announced on television that a state of emergency would be in place for one year, after which elections would be held. His takeover came as newly-elected lawmakers were due to take their places on the opening day of parliament. The state of emergency caused all legislative, executive, and judicial power to be transferred to Min Aung Hlaing.Zaw Min Tun said the state of emergency could be extended for an additional \"six months or more\" over \"two terms\" and \"if the duties are not done yet.\" He did not give a firm date for when elections would be held, but said that according to the 2008 military-drafted constitution, \"we have to finish everything within two years. We have to hold a free and fair election within these two years.\"\"We promise that we will make it happen,\" he said. Myanmar's Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on March 27.Many observers have questioned whether the military, which ruled Myanmar for half a century between 1962 and 2011, would be willing to relinquish power again, whether elections would indeed be \"free and fair\" -- and whether ousted leader Suu Kyi and her popular party the National League for Democracy (NLD) would be allowed to contest. Zaw Min Tun pointed to a string of reforms the quasi-civilian government embarked upon in 2011 after the military gave up direct rule, which paved the way for the 2015 elections, in which Suu Kyi won a resounding victory. \"If we didn't want her from the beginning there would be no process like this,\" he said. However, the 2008 constitution was designed so the military would retain power despite a civilian government. It allocated the military a quarter of seats in parliament, giving it effective veto power over constitutional amendments, and the generals kept control of three powerful ministries -- defense, border and home affairs.Myanmar&#39;s military is waging war on its citizens. Some say it&#39;s time to fight back Zaw Min Tun also highlighted that Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest and has not been seen in public since the coup, is facing five charges, including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios, and for breaking Covid-19 regulations. She has also been accused of corruption and bribery. The most serious charge, however, is violating violating the country's Official Secrets Act, which carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.\"What happened is because of the corruptions on national level and errors on state level procedures and we are accusing on the facts,\" Zaw Min Tun said. \"Daw Aung San Su Kyi is a well-known person both in Myanmar and the world and we will not accuse that person without any reason.\"But slapping perceived opponents with charges under vaguely-worded colonial-era laws has been a well-used tool by the military throughout its rule, and during the reform period. The charges against Suu Kyi have been described as \"trumped up\" by her lawyer, who called the bribery accusations a \"complete fabrication.\"To justify the coup, the junta has alleged widespread election fraud in the November vote that would have given the NLD a second term and a mandate to continue its reform agenda, which included attempts to amend the constitution to limit the military's power. Zaw Min Tun said the military had tried to negotiate with the NLD government but \"no action was taken.\" Photos: Aung San Suu KyiAung San Suu Kyi poses for a portrait in Yangon, Myanmar, in 2010.

The election commission denied there was mass voter fraud and independent election monitors said there were no substantial problems that would be enough to overturn the result. Suu Kyi won with 83% of the vote. Bloodshed on the streetsIt is evident from the interview that Myanmar's military leaders want the world to believe they are acting in line with the country's laws and constitution, and say they are committed to building a \"multi-party democratic county.\" But the bloodshed on the streets, in which soldiers and police have shot dead protesters, bystanders and children, belies that claim. At least 600 civilians have been killed by security forces, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The UN envoy has reported enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture in prisons. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said authorities have \"increasingly resorted to heavy weaponry such as rocket-propelled and fragmentation grenades, heavy machine guns, and snipers to kill demonstrators in massive numbers.\"A police officer aims a gun during clashes with protesters taking part in a demonstration against the military coup in Naypyidaw on February 9.Around 3,000 people have been detained, many kept out of contact from their families, their condition or whereabouts unknown. Meanwhile, protesters, activists, journalists and families of those killed by the junta, have been forced into hiding as they fear security forces will hunt them in nighttime raids.   On Wednesday, a special envoy of Myanmar's ousted civilian government to the UN warned of a civil war if the world fails to stop the junta from seizing power and killing pro-democracy protesters.  \"The bloodbath is real. It is coming, more people will die. I am afraid,\" Dr. Sasa said on CNN. \"It is the time for the world to prevent another genocide, another ethnic cleansing, another massacre, so the world has the power to stop it before it's too late.\"Myanmar&#39;s military is killing peaceful protesters. Here&#39;s what you need to knowZaw Min Tun blamed the violence on protesters \"provoking\" the crowd and said security forces cracked down because protesters \"blocked the civil servants\" from going to work. In reality, thousands of civil servants, as well as white- and blue-collar workers, including medics, bankers, lawyers, teachers, engineers and factory workers, left their jobs as a form of resistance against the coup. The strikes, called the Civil Disobedience Movement, have disrupted sectors of the economy. \"The crowds were throwing stones and slingshots at them in the beginning but later the crowd are blocking with sand bags, shooting with handmade guns, throwing with fire, throwing with molotov (cocktails) and the security forces have to use the weapons for the riot,\" Zaw Min Tun said. Asked whether he was seriously comparing slingshots to assault rifles, Zaw Min Tun said the security forces were using \"minimum force.\" \"There will be deaths when they are cracking down (on) the riots, but we are not shooting around without discipline,\" he said. Protesters gather to demonstrate against the February 1 military coup, in downtown in Yangon on February 8.According to the military, the death toll at the time of the interview was 248 people, including 10 police officers and six soldiers, he said -- less than half the toll documented by multiple human rights groups, which have repeatedly said security forces are violating international humanitarian law by shooting indiscriminately into crowds of peaceful protesters. Bullet wounds in the heads and necks of many of those shot also suggest the soldiers are shooting to kill. Video and images captured by local journalists and eyewitnesses and verified by CNN show security forces shooting into crowds. In others, security forces are beating detainees with their rifles, or dragging bodies through the streets. The killing of childrenAccording to the UN Children's Fund, 46 children have been killed since the coup. CNN has documented instances of children being shot in their homes or while playing outside. When asked about three teenagers who have died at the hands of security forces -- Kyaw Min Latt, 17, Htoo Myat Win, 13, and Tun Tun Aung, 14, -- the military spokesperson blamed protesters for \"using\" children on the front lines. \"In some places they provoke the children to participate in violence riots ... Because of that they may get hit when the security forces were cracking down (on) the crowds,\" he said. \"There is no reason we will shoot the children, this is only the terrorists are trying to make us look bad.\"He said it was \"not possible\" that a child would be shot inside their house and an investigation would be carried out if that was the case. Videos posted on social media corroborate that security forces have shot at houses. Grieving family of young girl shot dead by Myanmar&#39;s military forced into hidingHtoo Myat Win's father said his son was shot when several bullets smashed a glass window in his house in Shwebo city on March 27. \"I dodged the bullet but my son was coming up to the glass window and got hit,\" he said, adding that his son was hit in the chest. \"I don't understand why they have to shoot us when we were inside our house.\"\"They were shooting at protesters before and the protesters were running and we hid some of them because we worried that they might get arrested. They (army) must have positioned themselves in this neighborhood,\" he said.  Video widely circulated online showed Htoo Myat Win's distraught father screaming with grief in the back of a taxi as he rushed to his son's lifeless body for help. Forced to go to a military hospital, Htoo Myat Win's father said doctors there did an autopsy and told him to sign a document stating there was no bullet. \"I asked them my son die with a bullet wound why you want to say it is not from a bullet?\" he said. Perhaps keen to avoid creating martyrs, the military has sought to control the narrative over some high-profile deaths. Junta forces exhumed the body of one young protester and carried out an autopsy in which they determined the bullet that killed her did not come from a police gun. The wife of Phoe Chit, a protester who died during a demonstration against the military coup on March 3, cries over the coffin of her husband during his funeral in Yangon on March 5.In another incident, a military hospital claimed Kyaw Min Latt died after falling off his motorbike in Dawei city. CCTV footage, however, captured the moment a soldier standing on the back of a truck shot at the teenager as he rode with two others, who managed to run away. His mother verified the footage to CNN. \"The doctor told us that my son is suffering from the injuries of fall from motorbike, we couldn't say back anything except just kept say yes to everything,\" his mother Daw Mon Mon Oo said. She said X-rays of her son's body conducted at a second hospital were taken away by officials from the military-run hospital. His death certificate, seen by CNN, states Kyaw Min Latt died on March 30 because of \"the primary brain injury due to the fall from cycle (motorcycle).\"When his family were able to take his body home, his mother said \"there was no injury from the fall of the bike but only when there the bullet went in and out, and bruised on his right eye.\"sPressed by CNN about the allegations from families of soldiers shooting into houses and of the military attempting to cover up the causes of deaths, spokesperson Zaw Min Tun demanded CNN show him evidence. \"If that kind of thing occurred, we will have investigation for it,\" he said. \"There may be some videos which look suspicious but for our forces, we don't have any intention to shoot at innocent people.\"It is unclear whether the military has launched any internal investigations into repeated claims of extrajudicial killings.She was shot dead, her body dug up and her grave filled with cement. But her fight is not overCNN also pressed Zaw Min Tun on why at least 11 people were detained shortly after speaking with the CNN team in Yangon. Some were detained merely for flashing the three-finger salute from the Hunger Games movies that has become a symbol of resistance. According to three sources close to those detained, who spoke on condition of anonymity over fears of reprisal, eight were later released. Zaw Min Tun confirmed security forces detained three people from the first market and eight others at a second after interacting with the team on the ground. When asked by CNN what crime they had committed, he said they hadn't broken the law.\"The security forces were worried they would provoke others and start the protest in the market, and that is why they got arrested,\" he said, adding the military expressed \"regret\" over the arrests.CNN has since learned those eight are now in hiding, fearing rearrest. International reactionThe coup and subsequent deadly crackdown have been widely condemned internationally. The United States, United Kingdom and European Union have imposed sanctions on several generals in charge of the coup, as well as on military-owned companies. However, while Zaw Min Tun insisted elections would be held in the future, he warned the military's version of democracy would perhaps not be a Western-style liberal system. \"The democratic country we are building is the one suitable with our history and geography. The standard of democracy in Myanmar will not be the same as from Western counties,\" he said. Despite the dangers, protesters from all walks of life in Myanmar continue to demand the military hand back power to civilian control and are held fully accountable. They continue to call for the release of Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders. Myanmar's many ethnic minority groups, which have long fought for greater autonomy for their lands, are also demanding the military-written 2008 constitution be abolished and a federal democracy be established.Having grown up with a level of democracy, and political and economic freedoms their parents and grandparents didn't have, Myanmar's young people leading the resistance movement remain determined to fight for what they see as their future -- and they say they will not give up.\n",

      "(CNN)President Joe Biden will take his first, limited actions on gun control Thursday, directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately.The steps -- which also include nominating a gun control advocate to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- fulfill a commitment Biden made in the aftermath of two deadly shootings last month to take \"common sense\" steps right away to address gun violence. The morning of the planned announcement also brought news of another mass shooting, this time in South Carolina, where a local doctor and two children are among five killed at a home, according to authorities.But the actions fall short of the sweeping actions Biden promised as a candidate that must be passed by Congress, including a ban on assault weapons or enacting universal background checks. Senior administration officials framed the upcoming announcements as initial steps that would be followed by additional actions later on, including applying pressure on lawmakers to act.Biden said last month following a mass shooting in Colorado, \"I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future.\" But he has acknowledged that passing a massive new infrastructure plan — and not new gun laws — is his top legislative priority.Biden will make the announcements Thursday from the White House alongside his attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose Justice Department will be responsible for drafting the proposed rules.Read MoreGhost guns are handmade or self-assembled firearms that don't have serial numbers. Some can be fabricated in as little as 30 minutes using kits and parts purchased online. Biden will direct the Justice Department to issue a proposed rule to \"stop the proliferation\" of those weapons, though a senior administration official previewing the step declined to elaborate on how specifically the rule -- due in 30 days -- might work.Another proposed rule would target stabilizing braces for pistols, which aid in the weapons' accuracy and manage recoil. Under the new rule, the devices -- which the senior administration official contended turn pistols into short barreled rifles -- would be covered by regulations in the National Firearms Act, including requiring registration. Last month's mass shooter in Boulder, Colorado, used a pistol modified with an arm brace, according to a law enforcement source.The announcements will come as the President is expected to nominate David Chipman as the next director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a White House official told CNN. Chipman is a former ATF agent who serves as senior policy adviser at Giffords, the organization led by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who became a gun control advocate after being shot in 2011.The ATF has been without a permanent director since 2015.Biden also plans to announce new investments in intervention programs in violence-prone communities; a directive to the Justice Department to publish model \"red flag\" laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others; and a comprehensive report on firearms trafficking.Taken together, the actions amount to the first real steps by Biden's administration to combat gun violence. Inside the White House, efforts to devise executive actions have been led by White House Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice and Office of Public Engagement Director Cedric Richmond, administration officials and gun safety advocacy groups told CNN.That included meeting with some of those groups and fielding ideas for steps that Biden could take on his own. Some advocates had been clamoring for steps earlier in the administration, pointing to Biden's pledge to prioritize gun control during his campaign. But initial reaction from gun safety advocacy groups Wednesday evening was positive. \"Each of these executive actions will start to address the epidemic of gun violence that has raged throughout the pandemic, and begin to make good on President Biden's promise to be the strongest gun safety president in history,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.\"These much-needed executive actions will start saving lives right away, and our grassroots army of nearly 6 million supporters looks forward to standing behind President Biden as he urges the Senate to follow his lead and act,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement. While campaigning, Biden had said he would task his attorney general with instituting better enforcement of existing gun laws as a means of slowing gun violence. He also made a campaign pledge to send $900 million for community programs meant to combat violence, something the administration is sorting out how to fulfill.Following last month's shootings, Biden called on Congress to take steps like reenacting an assault weapons ban, with Vice President Kamala Harris, who argued for executive actions on the campaign trail, telling \"CBS This Morning\" that \"if we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation.\"The Democratic-controlled House passed gun legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales last month, but the bills face tougher paths in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim 50-50 majority and would need significant Republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster.Biden acknowledged during a news conference that his main legislative priority was passing an infrastructure package and that he believed careful timing was key to the success of any proposed bills.And he has acknowledged that his political capital is limited.\"I haven't done any counting yet,\" he said in March when asked whether he believed he had enough votes to pass significant reforms.As the nation's posture on guns has evolved, Biden has been front-and-center at most every stop along the way for more than three decades, from the triumph of a 10-year ban on assault weapons in 1994 to the disappointment of a failed push for universal background checks in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. Recent shootings in Georgia and Colorado had raised the question inside the West Wing over how much political capital Biden should expend on the matter, which has so often ended in frustration.This story has been updated with details about Biden's executive actions and reaction to them.\n",

      "(CNN)The special agent who led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into George Floyd's death struggled to make sense of a short phrase Floyd said last May as Derek Chauvin kneeled on him.Senior Special Agent James Reyerson was shown a clip from Minneapolis Police body-camera footage of Floyd saying something while handcuffed and in a prone position on the ground.\"Did it appear that Mr. Floyd said, 'I ate too many drugs?\" defense attorney Eric Nelson asked Reyerson.\"Yes, it did,\" Reyerson said.After a short break, the prosecution played for Reyerson a longer clip of the video that provided the lead up to that comment.Read More\"Having heard it in context, are you able to tell what Mr. Floyd is saying there?\" prosecutor Matthew Frank asked.\"Yes, I believe Mr. Floyd was saying, 'I ain't do no drugs,\" Reyerson replied.The testimony came on the eighth day of Chauvin's criminal trial as several investigators and forensic scientists testified about what they found at the crime scene, including Floyd's blood stains and a few white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine.Earlier in the day, a Los Angeles Police Department use-of-force expert hired by the prosecution testified that Chauvin had used excessive and deadly force on Floyd when none was needed.Black families still reeling from verdicts in police brutality cases warn justice is not promised in Chauvin trialThroughout the trial jurors have been closely watching and at various points taken notes on much of the testimony, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. However, the pool reports indicate that some jurors' attention flagged during the BCA investigators' testimony on Wednesday.This week's testimony has featured several police training experts who have countered the defense's argument that Chauvin \"did exactly what he had been trained to do\" when he restrained Floyd. Prosecutors have sought to show Chauvin used excessive and unreasonable force on Floyd and had a \"depraved mind\" without regard for human life.The focus on police policy and training comes after a first week of testimony centered on what happened to Floyd on his last day. The evidence included cellphones, surveillance cameras and police body cameras; testimony from distressed bystanders; descriptions from paramedics and police supervisors who responded to the scene; and Chauvin's own statements about what happened.Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter. Nelson has not indicated whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense.The trial, now in its second full week of testimony, is expected to last about a month.LAPD Sgt. says Chauvin used deadly forceLos Angeles Police Sergeant Jody Stiger said Chauvin's use of force was excessive.The LAPD use-of-force expert testified Wednesday that Chauvin used \"deadly force\" by holding his knee on Floyd's neck and back for more than 9 minutes in a situation where no force was necessary.   LAPD Sgt. Jody Stiger, in his second day on the stand, said the pressure of Chauvin's body weight on the back of Floyd's neck could have caused potentially lethal \"positional asphyxia.\"  \"He was in the prone position. He was not resisting. He was handcuffed. He was not attempting to evade. He was not attempting to resist,\" Stiger said of Floyd. \"And the pressure ... that was being caused by the body weight could cause positional asphyxia which could cause death.\" Stiger testified the dangers of positional asphyxia have been known in law enforcement for at least 20 years.He told the jury that \"no force should have been used,\" with three officers restraining Floyd and two others standing by.Chauvin is seen in the body camera video grabbing Floyd's fingers in an attempt to inflict pain to get him to comply, Stiger told the court. He was asked what if Floyd couldn't comply.\"At that point it is just pain,\" Stiger responded. He also testified that the crowd of bystanders gathered at the scene did not pose a threat to Chauvin or other officers -- an assertion made by the defense, which described the crowd as hostile. \"They were merely filming, and most of their concern was for Mr. Floyd,\" the expert testified.Police use-of-force instructor says Derek Chauvin&#39;s kneeling is not a trained restraintWhile it is possible for a crowd to distract an officer, Stiger does not believe it happened in this case because Chauvin was talking to Floyd.  \"In the body-worn video, you can hear Mr. Floyd displaying his discomfort and pain, and you can also hear the defendant responding to him,\" he said. On cross-examination, Stiger said some of the comments from bystanders could be considered potential threats and that officers are taught to predict future behavior. He also acknowledged that Chauvin could have used a Taser initially because Floyd actively resisted attempts to put him in a police vehicle.  Stiger's testimony initially began on Tuesday afternoon. He said that he has conducted over 2,500 use-of-force reviews.The sergeant said officers were initially justified in using force when Floyd actively resisted arrest and refused to get into the squad car. Floyd also kicked at officers when he was first taken to the ground, body camera video shows. The circumstances then changed.\"However, once he was placed in a prone position on the ground, he slowly ceased resistance and at that point the ex-officers, they should have slowed down or stopped their force as well,\" Stiger said.Forensic scientists say drugs found in both vehiclesJUST WATCHEDStandout moments from the Derek Chauvin trialReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStandout moments from the Derek Chauvin trial 04:22Prosecutors said in opening statements that Floyd struggled with opioid addiction, and Wednesday afternoon's testimony touched on the drugs connected to him.Several white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's vehicle, and a smaller pill with Floyd's saliva on it was found in the back of the police squad car, three forensic scientists said Wednesday.BCA investigator McKenzie Anderson searched the vehicles involved in May and then again months later after initially failing to collect some of the pills.In Floyd's vehicle, she found two packets of suboxone, a drug that treats opioid addiction, three white pills, and bills stuffed between the seat and the center console, she said.Forensic pathologist: The real key to the Chauvin verdictInside the police squad car, she initially recovered Floyd's shoes and a strap and noted eight bloodstains that matched Floyd's DNA. On her second search of the car, she recovered a pill with a rough texture that did not appear whole as well as several small pieces that she thought might be pill fragments. Tests confirmed the smaller pill had Floyd's saliva on it, she testified.Breahna Giles, a BCA forensic scientist, testified that she analyzed the white pills. They had the markings of a pill that would contain oxycodone and acetaminophen, but upon testing they actually contained methamphetamine and fentanyl, she said.In addition, the glass pipe recovered from the vehicle contained THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, but no plant material, Giles told the court.   Susan Neith, a forensic chemist who works for the company NMS Labs, also tested the same drugs to determine fentanyl and methamphetamine levels. She testified the fentanyl levels detected were average, and the methamphetamine levels were low.Lead investigator breaks down videoJames Reyerson, Senior Special Agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, led the investigation into Chauvin.Reyerson, the BCA senior special agent, described the extensive case into Chauvin and walked through parts of a composite video of him kneeling on Floyd for over nine minutes.Reyerson was shown officer body-camera footage synced up with bystander video that provided two perspectives of Floyd's final moments. The video shows Floyd stopped talking about four minutes into the video and stopped moving about five minutes in, even as Chauvin's body weight remained on Floyd in a prone position, Reyerson testified.Even after paramedics arrived, Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd for nearly a minute and a half until a paramedic motioned for him to get off.Investigators found several items in an envelope in the trunk of the squad car, including two $20 bills, one of which was ripped in half, as well as cigarettes and a small pipe, Reyerson said. Pills were also found in the back of the police squad car, he said.\n",

      "(CNN)As he approached a curve in the road, Tiger Woods apparently meant to hit the brakes but instead slammed on the gas -- causing a high-speed rollover crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday.  Six weeks after the golf legend suffered serious leg injuries, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the main causes of the crash were speed and Woods' inability to negotiate a curve.Tiger Woods is &#39;recovering and in good spirits&#39;The SUV reached a speed of up to 87 mph, Villanueva said -- far greater than the 45 mph speed limit. The golfer was driving a Genesis SUV around 7 a.m. February 23 when the vehicle veered off the road about 26 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles. Woods was driving in Rancho Palos Verdes when he hit a \"Welcome to Rolling Hills Estates\" sign, crossed a center divider and traveled more than 150 feet across the shoulder through shrubbery and an uprooted tree before coming to a stop, according to a search warrant affidavit of the vehicle's data recorder.  Read MoreTiger Woods&#39; injuries, explainedHe likely mistook the gas pedal for the brakes, as no braking was detected, Capt.

      "(CNN)A shocked South Carolina community was grieving and looking for answers Thursday after officials said a beloved doctor and four other people were shot and killed by a man who had gone from a local high school on to college and the NFL. York County Sheriff Kevin Tolson said that on Wednesday afternoon Phillip Adams, 32, shot two air conditioning technicians outside -- killing one -- then forced his way into Dr. Robert Lesslie's home in Rock Hill.Lesslie, his wife, Barbara Lesslie, and two grandchildren, ages 5 and 9, were found shot to death in a back room.What we know about the mass shooting in York County, South CarolinaAir conditioning technician James Lewis, of Gastonia, North Carolina, was found dead outside. The surviving technician, Robert Shook, is out of surgery, according to a Facebook post from his daughter on Thursday evening. Her father is in intensive care on a ventilator, she wrote.Read MoreShe said that she was able to see him and that he has a \"very long road ahead of him.\" Adams was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the bedroom of a home about a half mile away that he shared with his parents.Tolson said it was unclear why Adams took two guns to the Lesslie property in Rock Hill, a city of 74,000 residents just across the border from Charlotte, North Carolina.\"There's nothing about this right now that makes sense to any of us,\" the sheriff said.A statement from the doctor's four children said the family is dealing with unimaginable loss.\"While we know there are no answers that will satisfy the question 'why,' we are sure of one thing: we do not grieve as those without hope. Our hope is found in the promise of Jesus Christ, and we are enveloped by peace that surpasses all understanding,\" the statement says.Lesslie was a \"pillar in the community,\" Tolson said of the doctor, who served as Winthrop University's supervising physician and medical director, and founded a hospice service and a house-call doctors' service.\"He treated me in the past at his clinic. ... he knew everyone, he treated everyone with respect,\" Tolson recalled.Winthrop University President George Hynd said Lesslie's contributions to the school were wide-ranging.\"Students, in particular, have long benefitted from referrals to his practice when additional care was needed beyond our scope,\" Hynd said in a statement. \"I personally will be forever grateful to him for the advice and counsel he provided to our COVID-19 response team as we opened the campus last fall to residential living and learning.\"Many questions, few answersInvestigators do not yet know what led to the shootings, though they believe Adams was the only assailant, Tolson said.\"We probably have more questions than you do about this case,\" the sheriff told reporters Thursday.Something that Adams left at the home led investigators to believe he was the gunman, and they went to the nearby Adams family home, Tolson said.Officers removed the parents from the home, and tried to contact Adams. They eventually found him deceased, Tolson said, though they did not hear gunshots.Adams died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, York County Coroner Sabrina Gast said.Dr. Robert Lesslie is seen in Rock Hill in March 2009.When asked whether Adams, who played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015, was a patient of the doctor, Tolson said: \"We have not been able to verify that.\"Adams played for several NFL teamsA South Carolina state official confirmed to CNN Thursday that Adams played in the NFL. Phillip Adams, seen as a San Francisco 49ers player in 2010.Adams played as a defensive back from 2010 to 2015 for teams including the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons. He had five interceptions and 121 tackles in 78 games, according to NFL.com. He also returned 37 punts while with the Raiders and 49ers.Adams' father, Alonzo Adams, told Charlotte TV station WCNC on Thursday morning that Lesslie used to be his doctor years ago. He said his son was a quiet, good kid -- but he thought football had taken its toll.Phillip Adams played at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg before his NFL days. He went to Rock Hill High School in his hometown, according to a SCSU athletics media guide. The shootingAuthorities were called around 4:45 p.m. to the Lesslies' home just south of Rock Hill, Tolson said. Tolson played two 911 calls for reporters at a news conference Thursday. In one, the air conditioning technicians' employer tells a 911 operator that a wounded worker had just called him about the shooting.\"(The worker was) screaming that he had been shot, and the other technician ... had been shot and was non-responsive,\" the caller tells the 911 operator.In the other call, a man tells an operator he was mowing grass when he heard popping noises. He says he went over to the Lesslie's property and from a distance saw one man lying on the ground and that's when he realized he had heard gunfire.The caller says he saw a man in black clothes walk out of the house.While the witness said he might have heard about 20 shots, the sheriff only confirmed there were \"multiple shots.\"Doctor had been practicing in area since 1981Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted his condolences to the victims.\"Tragic and heartbreaking news from Rock Hill this morning. Please join @1stLadySC and I in lifting up the Lesslie family in prayer during this difficult time,\" the tweet read.Trent Faris, the York County Sheriff's Office's spokesperson, said Thursday he knew Lesslie, and that \"Dr. Lesslie was my doctor growing up.\"\"Dr. Lesslie has been one of those people that everybody knows. He started Riverview Medical Center in Rock Hill and it has been a staple in Rock Hill for years,\" Faris said.\"If you are from Rock Hill and you are from around this area, the people who are involved are very prominent and very well known in York County,\" Faris said.Lesslie was the founder of Riverview House Calls and Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care, according to the services' joint website, and had been practicing in Rock Hill since 1981. In a personal bio page, Lesslie says he and his wife had been married for 40 years, raised four children and had nine grandchildren.\"In my spare time, I enjoy ​writing, golf, hunting, growing fruit and hops, and bagpiping,\" the bio page says. His website lists several books he authored, including 2008's \"Angels in the ER,\" a book about faith in God and the work of nurses, doctors and others during trying circumstances during his years working in an emergency room.\"I've been an observer of human condition as well as a physician. There's no better place to be an observer than the ER,\" he told The Herald of Rock Hill about the book in 2008. \"You find out what people are about. Everybody has something to teach us. I wanted to do this from a spiritual perspective. Once that became clear to me, it wrote itself.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — A local entrepreneur in the Japanese tourist destination of Nara has developed an alternative to plastic shopping bags, to protect the town's sacred deer.Hidetoshi Matsukawa, who works for Nara-ism, a souvenir wholesale agent, told CNN he heard last year that the deer, which roam the city's park, were dying after ingesting plastic bags.\"I wanted to do something to protect the deer, which is the symbol of Nara,\" he said.The bags are made from rice bran and milk cartons.Courtesy BunyodoThe city is home to around 1,000 sacred deer, which are officially designated as a national natural treasure in Japan, and many tourists feed them treats. In July 2019, however, a local welfare group said nine deer had been found dead, with plastic bags in their stomachs, and called on visitors not to throw away plastic bags in the park.Matsukawa wanted to come up with a different solution to the problem, and teamed up with a local paper manufacturer and a design firm to work on the project.These plastic bags were pulled from the stomach of a dead deer.Courtesy BunyodoBetween them they developed \"Shikagami,\" or deer paper, which is made from rice bran and milk cartons.\"We learned rice bran are mostly wasted in the process of rice polishing,\" said Matsukawa. \"So this paper helps to reduce that waste as well.\" Matsukawa has had the bags tested and says they are safe for human consumption.Related contentHow to (safely) enjoy Japan&#x27;s famed deer park\"We do not have the data to back up that this paper is not harmful to deers, but I believe this is safe for them as well as for human beings,\" he said, laughing. The bags have since been tested at local banks and the Todaiji temple, Nara's main tourist attraction. The temple and banks bought 4,000-5,000 of the bags for 100 yen (around 95 cents) each as part of the pilot project.Related content9 deer in a sacred sanctuary in Japan have been found dead with plastic in their stomachsThe price will fall if more businesses sign up to use the bags, said Matsukawa, who dreams of replacing plastic bags across the city to prevent more deer from dying after eating them.\"The news about the death of deer by plastic bags creates a negative image, as though the park is a cemetery for deer,\" he said. \"The paper bags can protect deer, as well as the brand image of Nara with deer.\"Just 45 minutes from Kyoto by train, Nara is a popular destination for visitors to Japan.\n",

      "(CNN)Having endured a bloody civil war from 1983 until 2009, Sri Lanka is now at peace and developing rapidly. That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat. Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don't connect with each other. \"We've lost a lot of leopards,\" says Watson. Nobody knows how many prowled the land before the war, but about 70% of the animals' habitat has been destroyed, and only 750 to 1,000 adult leopards remain, she says.Find out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable futureWhat's more, leopards are at risk of getting caught in snares. The wire traps are usually set for bushmeat species, including wild boar and deer, but they are indiscriminate in what they catch.

A passion for wildlife Watson grew up in the city of Colombo, but \"I loved being out in wild spaces ... I have a strong affinity with animals\" she says.       (Video courtesy of Chitral Jayatilake)  In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island's southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives -- and to count them.  Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots -- and famously, their spots never change. Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap imagesInstalling the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.Anjali Watson attaches a motion-detecting camera to a tree.Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting -- leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares. Watson hopes that WWCT's data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these \"beautiful, fabulous creatures\" survive.\n",

      "(CNN)Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. A Japanese serow explores the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.Read More\"Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,\" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Chernobyl control room now open to visitors -- but only wearing a hazmat suitPhotographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers captured images of more than 20 species, including macaque monkeys, in the areas surrounding the plant. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be \"in conflict\" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.Inside Slavutych, the city created by the Chernobyl explosionWhile the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team's research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster.\n",

      "(CNN) — China has revealed a prototype for a new high-speed Maglev train that is capable of reaching speeds of 620 kilometers (385 miles) per hour.The train runs on high-temperature superconducting (HTS) power that makes it look as if the train is floating along the magnetized tracks. The sleek 21-meter-long (69 feet) prototype was unveiled to media in the city of Chengdu, Sichuan Province, on January 13. In addition, university researchers constructed 165 meters (541 feet) of track to demonstrate how the train would look and feel in transit, according to state-run Xinhua News. Related contentChina debuts bullet train that can operate in extremely cold temperatures Professor He Chuan (vice president of Southwest Jiaotong University, which worked on the prototype) told reporters that the train could be \"operational\" within 3-10 years. He added: \"Sichuan has rich rare earth resources, which is very beneficial to our construction of permanent magnet tracks, thus promoting the faster development of experiments.\"One possible interior for the new Maglev train.Liu Kun/Xinhua/Sipa USAChina is home to the world's largest high-speed rail network, which stretches over 37,000 kilometers, and the fastest commercially operating train -- the Shanghai maglev. The country's first high-speed Maglev train, it began operating in 2003. Running at a top speed of 431 kph, the train links Shanghai Pudong Airport and Longyang Road in the eastern side of Shanghai.

      "data-paragraph-id=\"paragraph_5F6C8588-5954-D4B3-4F68-728163F5B19D\">Shanghai residents passing through the city's eastern Huangpu district in October might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a \"walking\" building.An 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground -- in its entirety -- and relocated using new technology dubbed the \"walking machine.\" In the city's latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.The supports act like robotic legs. They're split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.\"It's like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,\" he said.A timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.According to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghai's former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023. Workers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic \"legs\" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.Over the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.The project marks the first time this \"walking machine\" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.Decades of destructionIn recent decades, China's rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country. Some cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.Official indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the \"Four Olds\" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).Can &#x27;fast-forward&#x27; China safeguard its past? Mao's death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with China's government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.Nonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority. In the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.Should China move its historic monuments?In the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers. These conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.\"Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,\" said Lan, the Shanghai primary school's project supervisor. \"I'd rather not touch the historical buildings at all.\"He added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels. Building relocations he said however, are \"a viable option.\" \"The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. I'm happy to see that progress in recent years.\" Moving monumentsShanghai has arguably been China's most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century \"shikumen\" (or \"stone gate\") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out. The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.More recently, in 2018, the city relocated a 90-year-old building in Hongkou district, in what was then considered to be Shanghai's most complex relocation project to date, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.There are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance. But the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- it's T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua. The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan. An aerial shot of the Shanghai Lagena Primary School building.  Credit: Shanghai Evolution Shift ProjectThe building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method. \"During my 23 years of working in this area, I haven't seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,\" he added.Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the \"walking machine,\" Xinhua said. Lan told CNN he couldn't share the exact cost of the project, and that relocation costs will differ case by case.\"It can't be used as a reference, because we have to preserve the historical building no matter what,\" he said. \"But in general, it's cheaper than demolishing and then rebuilding something in a new location.\"\n",

      "Hong Kong (CNN Business)The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years. In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA)-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin. Read MoreIt also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.\n",

      "\"It's a dream,\" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. \"After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.\"Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. \"We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,\" he said. \"The AI software is better [now.]\"\"From a technical point of view, the car is ready,\" Xiao said. \"It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.\"AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called \"Professor X.\" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.&#39;I&#39;m not drunk, it&#39;s my car:&#39;  Tesla&#39;s &#39;full self-driving&#39; gets mixed reviewsThis year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing.

Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities.

In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.\"The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,\" he added. \"For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.\"China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.\"The bar is incredibly high,\" he said. \"It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Japan, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.The basicsJapan was lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has seen a surge in cases, with a major spike in November and December. Prime Minister Suga announced on February 9 that all foreign nationals would be barred from entering the country, but did not specify a start date or give details about how this would be implemented. While the Tokyo Olympics are still scheduled to take place in 2021, Reuters reports that it is highly likely that foreign residents would be barred from attending or being in the audience. The IOC and Japanese government will make an official announcement on the matter in early March. Although all foreign nationals have been barred from attending the Olympics in summer 2021 and are mostly unable to enter the country, Japanese authorities announced that they are considering testing any foreigner entering the country for the newer coronavirus variants. What's on offerA heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo's Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit.Who can goJapan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world, with 152 countries on its prohibited list. Visitors from Australia, Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam may enter the country, although those traveling from China and South Korea can only arrive into the country via Tokyo Narita airport. Additionally, those traveling for study, work or to join family (subject to visa requirements) may enter. That said, there are many exceptions and the rules change constantly. Consult MOFA for the latest information.Prime Minister Suga announced on January 14 that the borders would close to all foreign nationals, although there were no specifics on beginning and ending dates. He also did not specify whether this would apply to foreign citizens with Japanese residency.What are the restrictions?Travelers from permitted destinations must undertake a 14-day quarantine, although it is possible to request a PCR test on arrival. A negative result allows you to finish quarantine. Those traveling under Japan's revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.The prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo and Miyagi are strengthening their Covid-19 measures amid a rise in cases in the country as of April 6. The regulations are set to last for at least one month. Under the guidelines, bars and restaurants are required to close by 8pm and will bar entry to customers who aren't wearing masks.What's the Covid situation?After low infection rates in the first wave, Japan has seen a sharp increase in cases. The Japanese government's 'Go To Travel' scheme, which subsidized domestic tourism in a bid to boost the economy, has been blamed by some for the rise in positive infections.Tokyo has been particularly hard hit. The capital recorded 599 on January 7, the single highest per-day number since the start of the pandemic. Since then, the daily infection rate has remained in the four figures daily. On March 31, Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura announced that Japan was in serious danger of entering a \"fourth wave\" of infections, with 34 of 47 prefectures reporting a rise in cases. Osaka clocked 599 cases that day, its highest single-day total since January.As of April 6, Japan has reported 486,792 confirmed cases of the virus and 9,229 deaths. The vaccine rollout has been slow compared to others in Asia due to a shortage of medical professionals and a lack of syringes. What can visitors expect?While much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public.Useful linksMinistry of Foreign AffairsJapan Tourist BoardOur latest coverageThere's so much to see in Japan. Osaka is now home to the world's first -- and so far only -- Super Nintendo World, where visitors can put on virtual reality glasses and play a real-life version of Mario Kart. Fukushima is ready for tourists again, while you can practice shirin yoku, or forest bathing, in Kyoto's Sagano Bamboo Forest. For something a little less idyllic, there's a museum dedicated to poop in Yokohama. Or get stuck into the renowned food scene, with record-breaking snow crab and $185 steak sandwiches.Joe Minihane, Julia Buckley and Lilit Marcus contributed to this story\n",

      "(CNN) — The island nation of Sri Lanka is now open to tourists from all countries.Sri Lanka Minister of Tourism Prasanna Ranatunga made the official announcement during a press conference on Thursday, confirming they would reopen the country's borders from January 21. Both of the country's international airports reopened on the same day. \"The livelihood of around 3 million people depends on tourism in Sri Lanka,\" Ranatunga told media. \"It is our national responsibility to take into consideration the needs of our citizens that depend on this industry.\"  As part of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Sri Lanka created a \"bio bubble,\" which will give visitors a relative amount of freedom to travel within the country while still observing safety protocols.Though there is no minimum time that a visitor must spend in the country, anyone coming from abroad must stay in a government-approved hotel or resort for up to two weeks upon arrival. That means that travelers only coming for a short trip will just stay in their resort the entire time, while people who are planning longer stays will be able to move more freely within Sri Lanka once they complete their two-weeks of semi-quarantine.Related contentHow to explore Sri Lanka&#x27;s southern coast in styleUnlike places like Hong Kong and Australia, where people quarantining upon arrival must stay in their hotel rooms for the entire duration, Sri Lanka's regulations are a bit laxer. Guests will have free rein on-property, so they can use facilities like pools, gyms, salons and restaurants. Travelers can also leave the hotel during quarantine to go sightseeing, provided they do so carefully. About a dozen tourism sites and attractions are open to foreign visitors, but with caveats. The five-star Anantara Peace Haven in Tangalle is on the list of approved hotels.Anantara Peace Haven TangalleFor instance, as part of the \"bio bubble,\" attractions like Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, both in the central city of Kandy, require visitors to come as part of an organized tour group or with an approved Sri Lankan guide. They must travel in a private vehicle and not make any unauthorized side stops. Some sites will only allow tourists during designated time slots or on certain days of the week.Currently, 55 hotels and resorts fall under the \"safe and secure level one\" guidelines. They are not allowed to accept any local guests or host any events while they're part of the bio bubble.With extra security comes extra fees. In addition to paying for flights and accommodation, travelers are responsible for the cost of Sri Lanka's government-sanctioned health insurance ($12 US) and up to three Covid tests in-country ($40 each). Everyone coming into the country must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 96 hours of travel and fill out an online health declaration form. Guests will be tested again at their own expense on the fifth and seventh days after arriving and people staying longer than seven days will have to take a third test the following week. Once the two weeks are up and they have a negative coronavirus test, travelers can stay at their hotel or switch to another one of the approved hotels. Airbnbs, guest houses and other forms of accommodation are off limits. Taking public transit is discouraged.All prospective travelers must apply for a visa online and download the Visit Sri Lanka app. The app will be used for contact tracing as well as storing information about test results and hotel bookings.Sigiriya Fortress is among the dozen or so Sri Lanka attractions open to foreign tourists.  ALEX OGLE/AFP/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile nearly every country can demonstrably show that its tourism revenue had taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, Sri Lanka has suffered from particularly unlucky timing. A series of terrorist attacks in the capital of Colombo on Easter Sunday 2019 heavily dented the country's tourism scene, and Sri Lanka had just finished rebuilding its infrastructure when the pandemic hit.Following the initial Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020, most countries in Asia closed their borders to tourism and few have reopened since. Sri Lanka will join the Maldives as one of two destinations in the region with open borders.\n",

      "(CNN) — Singapore's national carrier is hoping to become the world's first airline to get all of its crew members vaccinated against Covid-19.Singapore Airlines (SIA) confirmed to CNN Travel that all of their crew members -- including pilots, gate agents, flight attendants and anyone whose job requires contact with the public -- have been offered free coronavirus vaccines by the Singaporean government. The country has purchased the Pfizer vaccine, which requires two shots.\"We are grateful to the Singapore government for making the aviation sector a priority in the country's vaccination exercise,\" the airline's CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said in a statement that was emailed out to the whole company on January 18. \"This reflects the sector's importance, and the crucial role we play in both Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against the pandemic.\"Related contentSingapore introduces &#x27;cruises to nowhere&#x27; for travel-starved localsAccording to the airline, 5,200 SIA employees have already signed up to get their shots. Inoculations will begin in a few days.Phong, alongside Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung, was among the city-state's first citizens to get vaccinated. He has received the first of his two shots, and reports that \"the procedure was painless and fuss-free.\" Once vaccinated, crew members will be subject to less scrutiny and fewer coronavirus-related security measures. For example, flight crew who are currently tested on the seventh day after their return to Singapore will be exempt from this test going forward.Related contentWhat&#x27;s happening at Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport during CovidSingapore's response to the pandemic has been largely successful due to border closures and a national contract-tracing app. The country has had 59,113 confirmed cases of the virus and only 29 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Still, citizens of the city-state have expressed an interest in being able to travel again. A much-hyped \"travel bubble\" with Hong Kong was indefinitely postponed in December when Hong Kong had a spike in virus cases. The annual Henley Passport Index placed Singapore second in the world -- just one point behind nearby Japan -- for passport power. Singaporeans can enter 190 countries or territories around the world without needing a visa.\n",

      "(CNN) — A slab of stone, engraved with intricate lines and motifs dating to the Bronze Age, has been revealed to be Europe's oldest map, researchers say.Using high-resolution 3D surveys and photogrammetry, researchers re-examined the Saint-Bélec Slab -- an engraved and partly broken piece of stone that was discovered in 1900 but forgotten about for almost a century.Researchers from the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap), the UK's Bournemouth University, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Western Brittany say the recent study of the stone has revealed it to be the oldest cartographic representation of a known territory in Europe.Researchers noticed that the slab&#x27;s topography resembled a valley, with lines representing a river network.From Bournemouth UniversityThe slab, which boasts intricate carvings and scattered motifs, has had a busy life: unearthed from a burial mound in western Brittany, it is thought to have been reused in an ancient burial toward the end of the early Bronze Age (between 1900 and 1640 BCE), experts say, where it formed a wall of a small, coffin-like box containing human remains. At the time of excavation, the 12.7-foot-long slab was already broken and missing its upper half.In 1900, it was moved to a private museum, and until the 1990s, it was stored in the National Museum of Archaeology in the castle of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in a niche in the castle moat. In 2014, it was rediscovered in one of the museum's cellars.Related contentBronze Age Britons kept human remains on display in their homesUpon studying the rediscovered slab, researchers found the carvings resembled a map, with repeated motifs joined by lines.They noticed that its surface was deliberately 3D-shaped to represent a valley, with lines in the stone thought to depict a river network.Related contentSmall silver snail artifact may be a medieval &#x27;meme&#x27;The team noticed similarities between the engravings and elements of the landscape of western Brittany, with the territory represented on the slab appearing to show a region of about 19 miles by 13 miles, along the course of the Odet river. Clément Nicolas, a postdoctoral researcher at Bournemouth University and first author of the study, told CNN that the discovery \"highlights the cartographic knowledge of prehistoric societies.\"But there are still many unknowns, including why the slab was broken in the first place.\"The Saint-Bélec Slab depicts the territory of a strongly hierarchical political entity that tightly controlled a territory in the early Bronze Age, and breaking it may have indicated condemnation and deconsecration,\" Nicolas said.The study was published in the French journal Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française.A previous headline misstated the age of the stone. This has been corrected.\n",

      "(CNN)President Joe Biden will take his first, limited actions on gun control Thursday, directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately.The steps -- which also include nominating a gun control advocate to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- fulfill a commitment Biden made in the aftermath of two deadly shootings last month to take \"common sense\" steps right away to address gun violence. The morning of the planned announcement also brought news of another mass shooting, this time in South Carolina, where a local doctor and two children are among five killed at a home, according to authorities.But the actions fall short of the sweeping actions Biden promised as a candidate that must be passed by Congress, including a ban on assault weapons or enacting universal background checks. Senior administration officials framed the upcoming announcements as initial steps that would be followed by additional actions later on, including applying pressure on lawmakers to act.Biden said last month following a mass shooting in Colorado, \"I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future.\" But he has acknowledged that passing a massive new infrastructure plan — and not new gun laws — is his top legislative priority.Biden will make the announcements Thursday from the White House alongside his attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose Justice Department will be responsible for drafting the proposed rules.Read MoreGhost guns are handmade or self-assembled firearms that don't have serial numbers. Some can be fabricated in as little as 30 minutes using kits and parts purchased online. Biden will direct the Justice Department to issue a proposed rule to \"stop the proliferation\" of those weapons, though a senior administration official previewing the step declined to elaborate on how specifically the rule -- due in 30 days -- might work.Another proposed rule would target stabilizing braces for pistols, which aid in the weapons' accuracy and manage recoil. Under the new rule, the devices -- which the senior administration official contended turn pistols into short barreled rifles -- would be covered by regulations in the National Firearms Act, including requiring registration. Last month's mass shooter in Boulder, Colorado, used a pistol modified with an arm brace, according to a law enforcement source.The announcements will come as the President is expected to nominate David Chipman as the next director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a White House official told CNN. Chipman is a former ATF agent who serves as senior policy adviser at Giffords, the organization led by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who became a gun control advocate after being shot in 2011.The ATF has been without a permanent director since 2015.Biden also plans to announce new investments in intervention programs in violence-prone communities; a directive to the Justice Department to publish model \"red flag\" laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others; and a comprehensive report on firearms trafficking.Taken together, the actions amount to the first real steps by Biden's administration to combat gun violence. Inside the White House, efforts to devise executive actions have been led by White House Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice and Office of Public Engagement Director Cedric Richmond, administration officials and gun safety advocacy groups told CNN.That included meeting with some of those groups and fielding ideas for steps that Biden could take on his own. Some advocates had been clamoring for steps earlier in the administration, pointing to Biden's pledge to prioritize gun control during his campaign. But initial reaction from gun safety advocacy groups Wednesday evening was positive. \"Each of these executive actions will start to address the epidemic of gun violence that has raged throughout the pandemic, and begin to make good on President Biden's promise to be the strongest gun safety president in history,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.\"These much-needed executive actions will start saving lives right away, and our grassroots army of nearly 6 million supporters looks forward to standing behind President Biden as he urges the Senate to follow his lead and act,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement. While campaigning, Biden had said he would task his attorney general with instituting better enforcement of existing gun laws as a means of slowing gun violence. He also made a campaign pledge to send $900 million for community programs meant to combat violence, something the administration is sorting out how to fulfill.Following last month's shootings, Biden called on Congress to take steps like reenacting an assault weapons ban, with Vice President Kamala Harris, who argued for executive actions on the campaign trail, telling \"CBS This Morning\" that \"if we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation.\"The Democratic-controlled House passed gun legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales last month, but the bills face tougher paths in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim 50-50 majority and would need significant Republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster.Biden acknowledged during a news conference that his main legislative priority was passing an infrastructure package and that he believed careful timing was key to the success of any proposed bills.And he has acknowledged that his political capital is limited.\"I haven't done any counting yet,\" he said in March when asked whether he believed he had enough votes to pass significant reforms.As the nation's posture on guns has evolved, Biden has been front-and-center at most every stop along the way for more than three decades, from the triumph of a 10-year ban on assault weapons in 1994 to the disappointment of a failed push for universal background checks in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. Recent shootings in Georgia and Colorado had raised the question inside the West Wing over how much political capital Biden should expend on the matter, which has so often ended in frustration.This story has been updated with details about Biden's executive actions and reaction to them.\n",

      "(CNN)The special agent who led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into George Floyd's death struggled to make sense of a short phrase Floyd said last May as Derek Chauvin kneeled on him.Senior Special Agent James Reyerson was shown a clip from Minneapolis Police body-camera footage of Floyd saying something while handcuffed and in a prone position on the ground.\"Did it appear that Mr. Floyd said, 'I ate too many drugs?\" defense attorney Eric Nelson asked Reyerson.\"Yes, it did,\" Reyerson said.After a short break, the prosecution played for Reyerson a longer clip of the video that provided the lead up to that comment.Read More\"Having heard it in context, are you able to tell what Mr. Floyd is saying there?\" prosecutor Matthew Frank asked.\"Yes, I believe Mr. Floyd was saying, 'I ain't do no drugs,\" Reyerson replied.The testimony came on the eighth day of Chauvin's criminal trial as several investigators and forensic scientists testified about what they found at the crime scene, including Floyd's blood stains and a few white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine.Earlier in the day, a Los Angeles Police Department use-of-force expert hired by the prosecution testified that Chauvin had used excessive and deadly force on Floyd when none was needed.Black families still reeling from verdicts in police brutality cases warn justice is not promised in Chauvin trialThroughout the trial jurors have been closely watching and at various points taken notes on much of the testimony, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. However, the pool reports indicate that some jurors' attention flagged during the BCA investigators' testimony on Wednesday.This week's testimony has featured several police training experts who have countered the defense's argument that Chauvin \"did exactly what he had been trained to do\" when he restrained Floyd. Prosecutors have sought to show Chauvin used excessive and unreasonable force on Floyd and had a \"depraved mind\" without regard for human life.The focus on police policy and training comes after a first week of testimony centered on what happened to Floyd on his last day. The evidence included cellphones, surveillance cameras and police body cameras; testimony from distressed bystanders; descriptions from paramedics and police supervisors who responded to the scene; and Chauvin's own statements about what happened.Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter. Nelson has not indicated whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense.The trial, now in its second full week of testimony, is expected to last about a month.LAPD Sgt. says Chauvin used deadly forceLos Angeles Police Sergeant Jody Stiger said Chauvin's use of force was excessive.The LAPD use-of-force expert testified Wednesday that Chauvin used \"deadly force\" by holding his knee on Floyd's neck and back for more than 9 minutes in a situation where no force was necessary.   LAPD Sgt. Jody Stiger, in his second day on the stand, said the pressure of Chauvin's body weight on the back of Floyd's neck could have caused potentially lethal \"positional asphyxia.\"  \"He was in the prone position. He was not resisting. He was handcuffed. He was not attempting to evade. He was not attempting to resist,\" Stiger said of Floyd. \"And the pressure ... that was being caused by the body weight could cause positional asphyxia which could cause death.\" Stiger testified the dangers of positional asphyxia have been known in law enforcement for at least 20 years.He told the jury that \"no force should have been used,\" with three officers restraining Floyd and two others standing by.Chauvin is seen in the body camera video grabbing Floyd's fingers in an attempt to inflict pain to get him to comply, Stiger told the court. He was asked what if Floyd couldn't comply.\"At that point it is just pain,\" Stiger responded. He also testified that the crowd of bystanders gathered at the scene did not pose a threat to Chauvin or other officers -- an assertion made by the defense, which described the crowd as hostile. \"They were merely filming, and most of their concern was for Mr. Floyd,\" the expert testified.Police use-of-force instructor says Derek Chauvin&#39;s kneeling is not a trained restraintWhile it is possible for a crowd to distract an officer, Stiger does not believe it happened in this case because Chauvin was talking to Floyd.  \"In the body-worn video, you can hear Mr. Floyd displaying his discomfort and pain, and you can also hear the defendant responding to him,\" he said. On cross-examination, Stiger said some of the comments from bystanders could be considered potential threats and that officers are taught to predict future behavior. He also acknowledged that Chauvin could have used a Taser initially because Floyd actively resisted attempts to put him in a police vehicle.  Stiger's testimony initially began on Tuesday afternoon. He said that he has conducted over 2,500 use-of-force reviews.The sergeant said officers were initially justified in using force when Floyd actively resisted arrest and refused to get into the squad car. Floyd also kicked at officers when he was first taken to the ground, body camera video shows. The circumstances then changed.\"However, once he was placed in a prone position on the ground, he slowly ceased resistance and at that point the ex-officers, they should have slowed down or stopped their force as well,\" Stiger said.Forensic scientists say drugs found in both vehiclesJUST WATCHEDStandout moments from the Derek Chauvin trialReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStandout moments from the Derek Chauvin trial 04:22Prosecutors said in opening statements that Floyd struggled with opioid addiction, and Wednesday afternoon's testimony touched on the drugs connected to him.Several white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's vehicle, and a smaller pill with Floyd's saliva on it was found in the back of the police squad car, three forensic scientists said Wednesday.BCA investigator McKenzie Anderson searched the vehicles involved in May and then again months later after initially failing to collect some of the pills.In Floyd's vehicle, she found two packets of suboxone, a drug that treats opioid addiction, three white pills, and bills stuffed between the seat and the center console, she said.Forensic pathologist: The real key to the Chauvin verdictInside the police squad car, she initially recovered Floyd's shoes and a strap and noted eight bloodstains that matched Floyd's DNA. On her second search of the car, she recovered a pill with a rough texture that did not appear whole as well as several small pieces that she thought might be pill fragments. Tests confirmed the smaller pill had Floyd's saliva on it, she testified.Breahna Giles, a BCA forensic scientist, testified that she analyzed the white pills. They had the markings of a pill that would contain oxycodone and acetaminophen, but upon testing they actually contained methamphetamine and fentanyl, she said.In addition, the glass pipe recovered from the vehicle contained THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, but no plant material, Giles told the court.   Susan Neith, a forensic chemist who works for the company NMS Labs, also tested the same drugs to determine fentanyl and methamphetamine levels. She testified the fentanyl levels detected were average, and the methamphetamine levels were low.Lead investigator breaks down videoJames Reyerson, Senior Special Agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, led the investigation into Chauvin.Reyerson, the BCA senior special agent, described the extensive case into Chauvin and walked through parts of a composite video of him kneeling on Floyd for over nine minutes.Reyerson was shown officer body-camera footage synced up with bystander video that provided two perspectives of Floyd's final moments. The video shows Floyd stopped talking about four minutes into the video and stopped moving about five minutes in, even as Chauvin's body weight remained on Floyd in a prone position, Reyerson testified.Even after paramedics arrived, Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd for nearly a minute and a half until a paramedic motioned for him to get off.Investigators found several items in an envelope in the trunk of the squad car, including two $20 bills, one of which was ripped in half, as well as cigarettes and a small pipe, Reyerson said. Pills were also found in the back of the police squad car, he said.\n",

Six weeks after the golf legend suffered serious leg injuries, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the main causes of the crash were speed and Woods' inability to negotiate a curve.Tiger Woods is &#39;recovering and in good spirits&#39;The SUV reached a speed of up to 87 mph, Villanueva said -- far greater than the 45 mph speed limit. The golfer was driving a Genesis SUV around 7 a.m. February 23 when the vehicle veered off the road about 26 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles. Woods was driving in Rancho Palos Verdes when he hit a \"Welcome to Rolling Hills Estates\" sign, crossed a center divider and traveled more than 150 feet across the shoulder through shrubbery and an uprooted tree before coming to a stop, according to a search warrant affidavit of the vehicle's data recorder.

      "(CNN)A shocked South Carolina community was grieving and looking for answers Thursday after officials said a beloved doctor and four other people were shot and killed by a man who had gone from a local high school on to college and the NFL. York County Sheriff Kevin Tolson said that on Wednesday afternoon Phillip Adams, 32, shot two air conditioning technicians outside -- killing one -- then forced his way into Dr. Robert Lesslie's home in Rock Hill.Lesslie, his wife, Barbara Lesslie, and two grandchildren, ages 5 and 9, were found shot to death in a back room.What we know about the mass shooting in York County, South CarolinaAir conditioning technician James Lewis, of Gastonia, North Carolina, was found dead outside. The surviving technician, Robert Shook, is out of surgery, according to a Facebook post from his daughter on Thursday evening. Her father is in intensive care on a ventilator, she wrote.Read MoreShe said that she was able to see him and that he has a \"very long road ahead of him.\" Adams was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the bedroom of a home about a half mile away that he shared with his parents.Tolson said it was unclear why Adams took two guns to the Lesslie property in Rock Hill, a city of 74,000 residents just across the border from Charlotte, North Carolina.\"There's nothing about this right now that makes sense to any of us,\" the sheriff said.A statement from the doctor's four children said the family is dealing with unimaginable loss.\"While we know there are no answers that will satisfy the question 'why,' we are sure of one thing: we do not grieve as those without hope. Our hope is found in the promise of Jesus Christ, and we are enveloped by peace that surpasses all understanding,\" the statement says.Lesslie was a \"pillar in the community,\" Tolson said of the doctor, who served as Winthrop University's supervising physician and medical director, and founded a hospice service and a house-call doctors' service.\"He treated me in the past at his clinic. ... he knew everyone, he treated everyone with respect,\" Tolson recalled.Winthrop University President George Hynd said Lesslie's contributions to the school were wide-ranging.\"Students, in particular, have long benefitted from referrals to his practice when additional care was needed beyond our scope,\" Hynd said in a statement. \"I personally will be forever grateful to him for the advice and counsel he provided to our COVID-19 response team as we opened the campus last fall to residential living and learning.\"Many questions, few answersInvestigators do not yet know what led to the shootings, though they believe Adams was the only assailant, Tolson said.\"We probably have more questions than you do about this case,\" the sheriff told reporters Thursday.Something that Adams left at the home led investigators to believe he was the gunman, and they went to the nearby Adams family home, Tolson said.Officers removed the parents from the home, and tried to contact Adams. They eventually found him deceased, Tolson said, though they did not hear gunshots.Adams died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, York County Coroner Sabrina Gast said.Dr. Robert Lesslie is seen in Rock Hill in March 2009.When asked whether Adams, who played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015, was a patient of the doctor, Tolson said: \"We have not been able to verify that.\"Adams played for several NFL teamsA South Carolina state official confirmed to CNN Thursday that Adams played in the NFL. Phillip Adams, seen as a San Francisco 49ers player in 2010.Adams played as a defensive back from 2010 to 2015 for teams including the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons. He had five interceptions and 121 tackles in 78 games, according to NFL.com. He also returned 37 punts while with the Raiders and 49ers.Adams' father, Alonzo Adams, told Charlotte TV station WCNC on Thursday morning that Lesslie used to be his doctor years ago. He said his son was a quiet, good kid -- but he thought football had taken its toll.Phillip Adams played at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg before his NFL days. He went to Rock Hill High School in his hometown, according to a SCSU athletics media guide. The shootingAuthorities were called around 4:45 p.m. to the Lesslies' home just south of Rock Hill, Tolson said. Tolson played two 911 calls for reporters at a news conference Thursday. In one, the air conditioning technicians' employer tells a 911 operator that a wounded worker had just called him about the shooting.\"(The worker was) screaming that he had been shot, and the other technician ... had been shot and was non-responsive,\" the caller tells the 911 operator.In the other call, a man tells an operator he was mowing grass when he heard popping noises. He says he went over to the Lesslie's property and from a distance saw one man lying on the ground and that's when he realized he had heard gunfire.The caller says he saw a man in black clothes walk out of the house.While the witness said he might have heard about 20 shots, the sheriff only confirmed there were \"multiple shots.\"Doctor had been practicing in area since 1981Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted his condolences to the victims.\"Tragic and heartbreaking news from Rock Hill this morning. Please join @1stLadySC and I in lifting up the Lesslie family in prayer during this difficult time,\" the tweet read.Trent Faris, the York County Sheriff's Office's spokesperson, said Thursday he knew Lesslie, and that \"Dr. Lesslie was my doctor growing up.\"\"Dr. Lesslie has been one of those people that everybody knows. He started Riverview Medical Center in Rock Hill and it has been a staple in Rock Hill for years,\" Faris said.\"If you are from Rock Hill and you are from around this area, the people who are involved are very prominent and very well known in York County,\" Faris said.Lesslie was the founder of Riverview House Calls and Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care, according to the services' joint website, and had been practicing in Rock Hill since 1981. In a personal bio page, Lesslie says he and his wife had been married for 40 years, raised four children and had nine grandchildren.\"In my spare time, I enjoy ​writing, golf, hunting, growing fruit and hops, and bagpiping,\" the bio page says. His website lists several books he authored, including 2008's \"Angels in the ER,\" a book about faith in God and the work of nurses, doctors and others during trying circumstances during his years working in an emergency room.\"I've been an observer of human condition as well as a physician. There's no better place to be an observer than the ER,\" he told The Herald of Rock Hill about the book in 2008. \"You find out what people are about. Everybody has something to teach us.

      "(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel. Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States. But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law. Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in. \"No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,\" he says. \"These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.\"Keeping cabins calmFlight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight.  As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline. Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.\"We are strongly against voice calls on planes,\" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: \"NO CELL PHONES.\" Related contentIs it OK to recline your seat? The great reclining debateFlight attendants' opposition is significant.  They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.\"At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,\" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas. \"If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.\"Passengers advocating for quietMost passengers don&#x27;t want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an \"annoying\" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate. Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.\"I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,\" he says. \"It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.\"Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.Related content17 best Christmas markets around the worldBusiness travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.\"For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,\" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. \"In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.\"One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.Is the technology safe?Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers&#x27; technology.  Shutterstock The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.The rise of smartphones changed everything. As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable. Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.Related contentHow to split a check: Evenly or itemize? Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.\"There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller.  \"But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.\" \"The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,\" says Miller. \"There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.\"Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.\"Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,\" he says. \"When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.\"Regulatory, practical obstaclesTexting is already permitted on some airlines. ShutterstockThough it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted. \"Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,\" he said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance. Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, \"The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.\" The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.Who calls people anyway?What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.\"When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,\" he says. \"On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.\"Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition. This means you may not be able to join that upcoming work call from 35,000 feet over the Mississippi Delta. It also means your holiday travel adventures likely won't include having to listen to your seat neighbor shout to a loved one grandma's recipe for Christmas struffoli. Consider yourself lucky.

      "(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market. And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir. Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its  first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang. But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's \"Prince Hamlet\" by local media.   Chang Kuo-wei founded STARLUX Airlines after being ousted from his family business, EVA Airways.courtesy Starlux AirlinesThis Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.  Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will. A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot. Related contentWorld&#x27;s best airlines for 2019 revealed by SkytraxBut being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members. A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines. \"He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'\"Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan. The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.China Airlines and its crew reached a deal after a week-long strike in February 2019 whereas EVA Airways experienced a 17-day strike in July, the longest in Taiwanese aviation history. But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. \"This has nothing to do with revenge.\"\"Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.\"CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.Homegrown luxury airlineLocal designer Sean Yin is behind STARLUX&#x27;s crew uniforms.courtesy Starlux AirlinesWhether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, \"both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,\" says Nieh.   Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.Related contentInside India&#x27;s aviation revolution and what it means for travelersChang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.\"The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,\" adds Nieh. The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes. Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system. Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven.  The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitorsPositioning as a boutique airline, STARLUX aims to capture the higher-end market.courtesy Starlux AirlinesAspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors. \"We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,\" adds Nieh. \"We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.\"We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.\"Related contentAsia&#x27;s 9 busiest airports in 2019According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX. \"Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,\" says Law. \"That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.\" But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.\"From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,\" says Law.Potential cut-throat competitionBoth EVA Airways and China Airlines, the two major airlines of Taiwan, have been affected by strikes in 2019.PATRICK LIN/AFP/Getty ImagesTaiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years. Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?\"A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,\" says Law.\"Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity. \"Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.\"Related contentWorld&#x27;s longest airline routesOne of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore? \"I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,\" says Law.\"It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,\" says Law.Nieh, on the other hand, is confident. \"The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours\" he says. Related contentTaiwan&#x27;s most beautiful places\"Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.\"Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers. \"Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,\" says Nieh. \"We're very certain about this part.\" The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.\"Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,\" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.\"All 188 seats on each of the three flights.\"We're very happy about it.

Construction delays at the third terminal of Taoyuan Airport have forced the airline to build its check-in counters,  airport office, maintenance hangar and apron spaces with very limited resources, says Nieh. \"The aviation industry is a huge investment and a labor-intensive industry,\" he adds. \"It's hard to make a profit. Founding an airline, thus, is a very arduous journey. STARLUX has first-class talents who understand the unique nature of the industry. It helps avoid unnecessary investment, ensuring a steady and healthy growth for STARLUX.\n",

      "Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle. Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around. While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility. In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey. Related contentThese are predicted to be the safest countries in the world to visit in 2020 Greater accessibilityThe circular line has 17 new stops, nearly doubling the number of existing stations.DA MARIE ODGAARD/AFP via Getty ImagesCityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations —  now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters. The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. \"First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,\" he said. \"But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.\" Courtesy The Copenhagen MetroPublic squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing. \"We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,\" said Olsen. Building the line was not without its challenges. Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. \"We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,\" he said. Glass and light are key design elements, and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyTechnical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station. Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction. \"A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,\" explained Olsen, \"If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.\" In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system. Related contentWorld&#x27;s most livable city for 2019, according to the Economist Intelligence UnitShiny, new railsThe new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyThe line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes. Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level. Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds. Related contentThe Copenhagen artificial ski slope atop a power plant is now openBike-friendly The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. \"Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,\" said Olsen. Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.This shiny new rail line is conductor-less and runs automatically.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyWhile these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes \"the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,\" he said. \"You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after.\" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro. With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest. \"The less people have to think about us, the better,\" he said. \"So if you can just rely on us and don't have to think much about using the Metro, because it's easy to use and you don't have to plan your journey, then I guess we're a success.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet \"floating\" above the reception desk.This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" where the \"girl\" has an iPhone in her hand, or a \"party girl\" interpretation of Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.And if you happen to book visit the \"secret\" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as \"The Da Vinci Code.\"Related contentBudapest hotels -- great options from luxury to budgetInstagram friendlyThe Mystery Hotel is set inside the former headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons.Courtesy Mystery Hotel BudapestWhile it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had \"likes\" in mind when conceptualizing the property.\"Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,\" Varró tells CNN Travel. \"Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.\"Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital. \"When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.\"Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.\"First impressions are everything,\" says Berényi. \"There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first. \"But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.\"One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.Freemasonry pastThe grand staircase is among the  elements preserved from the old building.Courtesy Mystery Hotel BudapestOne of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world. The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital. It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.\"After communism, the room was destroyed,\" says Varró. \"The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.\"I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.\"Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.\"As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,\" she says.Related contentThe best luxury bars in BudapestUnique suitesSome of the suites feature headboards with a modernized version of Leonardo Da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa.&quot; Courtesy Mystery Hotel BudapestThere are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains. Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel. \"The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,\" explains Varró.\"When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.\" The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&amp;Gabbana hiring it for private events.Related contentThe ultimate luxury spa guide to BudapestImpressive spa Based in the courtyard, the Secret Garden Day Spa is one of the hotel&#x27;s highlights.Courtesy Mystery Hotel BudapestWhile the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.\"This was an empty place,\" says Varró. \"I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.\"Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.\"We don't have thermal waters here, but we do have this,\" says Berényi. \"This Jacuzzi is very popular on Instagram.\"Mystery Hotel Budapest, 1064 Budapest, Podmaniczky utca 45; +36 1 616 6000\n",

      "(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the \"Pearl of the Danube,\" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.\"Hungary was always a pretty poor country,\" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. \"So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.\" Related content10 of the best restaurants in BudapestCulinary movement Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine. Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.\"We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,\" he tells CNN.\"Everything is completely different now.\"Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.\"When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,\" he says.Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often \"hammered by critics.\"\"My cooking has changed a lot,\" he adds. \"Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.\"\"One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.\"While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the \"ultimate goal\" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.\"I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,\" he adds. \"It's not looking for stars or for recognition.\"That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.\" Related contentBest attractions in Budapest: What you can&#x27;t missModern interpretationsChef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.\"Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,\" Szell tells CNN.\"Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.\"Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together. \"My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,\" he adds. \"My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.\"Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash. \"When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,\" he explains.Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched. In fact, Jokuti describes it as the \"the perfect Hungarian restaurant,\" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.\"This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,\" says Jokuti.Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,\"I think the ingredients are the most important thing,\" adds Szell. \"The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.\"Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.  Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.Veres says cooking is an \"obsession\" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.\"In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,\" he says.\"You put your soul on the plate.\"\"I'm never scared about new things.\" According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.\"Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,\" says Jokuti. \"I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.\"Related contentBudapest&#x27;s best cakes and where to find themBasic ingredientsSalt is tipped to become the next Budapest restaurant to receive a Michelin star.Courtesy Salt BudapestHoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.\"We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,\" Toth tells CNN.\"This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.\"The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.\"We have a course called greasy bread,\" says Boldizsar. \" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.\"Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.\" Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.\"I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,\" says Jokuti.A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.\"It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,\" says Jokuti.\"I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.\"It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.' \"It can be a pleasure, it can be an excitement.  We have achieved a very fantastic level.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — From traditional souks, mosques and UNESCO World Heritage sites, to futuristic skyscrapers, Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, offers an eclectic mix of old and new. Among the most startling additions to the modern skyline are the Flame Towers, a trio of sky-high structures that resemble tongues of fire reaching high over the Caspian Sea. Designed by US architecture firm HOK, and with Tower 1 standing at 182 meters, they're the tallest buildings in Azerbaijan.And visitors can stay in them -- one building's residential, one is for office use, while the third, the 165-meter-tall Fairmont Baku, is a contemporary five-star hotel. Related contentThe mud volcano capital of the world Enter the flameThe towers can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, but night is when they truly come alive. Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames. For some in Baku, they're now a symbol of home.\"You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,\" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. \"They're the sign that lets everybody know they've reached Azerbaijan.\"So what's it like to stay in one of the country's most familiar landmarks? It's certainly no ordinary hotel.The bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.  The venue's seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons. Taking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal, designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest. Guests shouldn't expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it's now only played by top pianists on special occasions. Come evening, the Flame Towers put on a light show enjoyed across the city. Courtesy Fairmont BakuSea viewsThe tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night. Even the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The décor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea. Crisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons. A typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service. The super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there's a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table. Then there's a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair.  The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There's an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room. In both of the suite's two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle. It's a souvenir just asking to be taken home. Fairmont Gold: There are panoramic views from the 19th floor. Courtesy Fairmont BakuRelated contentStalin&#x27;s Azerbaijan prison where water burns like fireThe royal suiteNice touches, but does the hotel have celeb appeal? Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel's PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but  the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.  \"We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,\" she tells CNN Travel. \"When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.\"Positioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.\"The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,\" explains Ismayilova. There's an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay. WellnessThe hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There's an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There's also a fully equipped gym. The beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There's an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up. It's best visited come evening. When the sun's up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.

The Balcon café offers specialty teas and cakes, as well as sushi in the afternoons. There's also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel's Jazz Club, a local institution.\"We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that's when it really gets going. It's very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,\" Ismayilova says.There are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.Park Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films. Next door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020. Luxury brands, high street names, cafes and restaurants are all set to take up residency.

      "(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents. In Japan, Okinawa's sprightly centenarians have earned it the nickname \"Land of the Immortals.\" Campodimele, Italy's \"Village of Eternity,\" is testament to the Mediterranean diet. In the sunny Californian town of Loma Linda, a community of Seventh-Day Adventists reaping rewards of clean living. There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan. The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including  Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians. In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life. The Museum of LongevityThe two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants. It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age. And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade. Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop. The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define \"centenarian\" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old. However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping. Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800. Related contentEternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the &#x27;Land of Fire&#x27;The tale of the 168-year-old manIs this the world&#x27;s oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla RzayevaLerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168. The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived. Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born. Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.  Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, \"Dear Grandpa.\"This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt. 'Stillness of the mind' When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran, but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father). Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as \"vulnerable\" by UNESCO. She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, \"15.\" \"Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,\" the museum guide says. \"They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.\"Good nutrition and natural remediesHalima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla RzayevaQambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. \"I get up as soon as my eyes open,\" she says.She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back. Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance. Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea. It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik. \"The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,\" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication. Related contentAzerbaijan: Culinary gateway to the East Generations living side by sideBeyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families. Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes. At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them. Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.'Whatever God gives'Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva\"He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,\" his son says. In terms of food, he eats \"whatever God gives\" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol. Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body. Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity. The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor. A 2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain, found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer. The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.

      "(CNN) — \"This fire has burned 4,000 years and never stopped,\" says Aliyeva Rahila. \"Even the rain coming here, snow, wind -- it never stops burning.\"Ahead, tall flames dance restlessly across a 10-meter stretch of hillside, making a hot day even hotter. This is Yanar Dag -- meaning \"burning mountainside\" -- on Azerbaijan's Absheron Peninsula, where Rahila works as a tour guide.A side effect of the country's plentiful natural gas reserves, which sometimes leak to the surface, Yanar Dag is one of several spontaneously occurring fires to have fascinated and frightened travelers to Azerbaijan over the millennia. Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the mysterious phenomena when he passed through the country in the 13th century. Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would travel to other lands. It's why the country earned the moniker the \"land of fire.\" Related contentThe mud volcano capital of the world Ancient religion Such fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.Yanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive. At one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE. levartFor Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship. Today, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.The experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila. Despite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.Related contentNaftalan: The Azerbaijan resort where guests bathe in crude oil Ateshgah Fire TempleFor a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.\"Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,\" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku. Fire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for \"home of fire\" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent. A natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors. The temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented. Related contentSheki: Azerbaijan&#x27;s Silk Road city of caravans and khans Merchants and asceticsBuilt like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms. These were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end. The temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold. The complex became a museum in 1975, was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998, and today welcomes around 15,000 visitors a year.\n",
